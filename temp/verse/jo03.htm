  <p>
    Do you ever dream you hear it, you who went the lonely track?<br>
    Do you ever hear its simple melodies<br>
    Tossing round deserted beaches, with the flotsam and the wrack,<br>
    When the moonlight sprinkles silver on the trees?
  </p>

  <p>
    Do you hearken now, I wonder, when the birds have gone to rest,<br>
    And the blotted book of day once more is shut?<br>
    When the saffron stains have faded, and the swans have vanished west,<br>
    Does your heart remember Peter Nelson's hut?
  </p>

  <p>
    Lonely, stooped old Peter Nelson, with his "most peculiar" ways,<br>
    With the clean-cut face, and hair as white as snow!<br>
    Something lingering round the old man seemed to tell of better days,<br>
    Seemed to hint of love and laughter long ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    Kindly silence wrapped the bushland; every warring note was still<br>
    Soft heart-tremors stirred, and smiling eyes grew dim.<br>
    Weaving fancies went the fiddle; dreams prophetic made us thrill-<br>
    From the grave the visions stretched their hands to him.
  </p>

  <p>
    There was rapture in the stillness; there were voices in the night;<br>
    Trooped the angels with a beat of velvet wings;<br>
    And the stars stood still and listened, and the moon's face, strangely white,<br>
    Kissed the sleeping world to dreams of better things.
  </p>

  <p>
    Joy was lit in every corner, love was smiling at our side,<br>
    Golden glamour o'er the dawning days was cast;<br>
    Gaily, gaily sang the fiddle, while we marched with swinging stride<br>
    Through the flowers that hid the failures of the past.
  </p>

  <p>
    Do you ever dream you hear it? Does it bring the vision back,<br>
    With the curlew, and the moonlight ore the trees?<br>
    Do the waveless ripple shoreward with the flotsam and the wrack,<br>
    When a fiddle plays the simple melodies ?
  </p>

  <p>
    Lonely, bent old Peter Nelson with the quaint, uncommon ways,<br>
    "Spruced and tidied" when the book of day was shut,<br>
    With the dim light in the window, and the friends of better days<br>
    Summoned round him by the fiddle in the hut.
