  <p>
    Wilt thou love me, sweet, when my hair is grey<br>
    And my cheeks shall have lost their hue?<br>
    When the charms of youth shall have passed away,<br>
    Will your love as of old prove true?
  </p>

  <p>
    For the looks may change, and the heart may range,<br>
    And the love be no longer fond;<br>
    Wilt thou love with truth in the years of youth<br>
    And away to the years beyond?
  </p>

  <p>
    Oh, I love you, sweet, for your locks of brown<br>
    And the blush on your cheek that lies --<br>
    But I love you most for the kindly heart<br>
    That I see in your sweet blue eyes.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the eyes are signs of the soul within,<br>
    Of the heart that is leal and true,<br>
    And mine own sweetheart, I shall love you still,<br>
    Just as long as your eyes are blue.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the locks may bleach, and the cheeks of peach<br>
    May be reft of their golden hue;<br>
    But mine own sweetheart, I shall love you still,<br>
    Just as long as your eyes are blue.
    <br>
