  <p>
    Family trees are funny things, they grow from many roots.<br>
    Some grow tall and thin and lean, some spread lots of shoots.
  </p>

  <p>The favoured trees all blossom, groomed perfection as they grow;<br>
    The dead wood soon forgotten, overshadowed by the glow.
  </p>

  <p>
    The cultured trees stand stately in the ordered orchard rows,<br>
    Their tendered lives are fertilized by goodness only knows.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fruit they bear is polished and stands out in market place;<br>
    They can't afford a blemish and will stand for no disgrace.
  </p>

  <p>
    The wilder woods grow far and wide and fight for pure survival;<br>
    Compete with weeds and undergrowth amid unwanted rival.
  </p>

  <p>
    Their limbs untrimmed are gangly, they bend and twist awry,<br>
    The fruit they bear is burdened by the carrion and fruit-fly.
  </p>

  <p>
    The weaker limbs are shattered, lay defiant on the ground,<br>
    Their fruits condemned to gutters in the race of life unsound.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the frail grow strong and battle on with fortitude and fervour,<br>
    They never fail in wind or gail, noticed by the keen observer.
  </p>

  <p>
    The weak are strong, and linger on and never bend or sway<br>
    Distinction shown by independance, forever and a day.<font SIZE="2">&nbsp;</td>
