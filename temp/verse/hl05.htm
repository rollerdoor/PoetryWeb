  <p>
    It was a week from Christmas-time,<br>
    As near as I remember,<br>
    And half a year since, in the rear,<br>
    We'd left the Darling timber.<br>
    The track was hot and more than drear;<br>
    The day dragged out for ever;<br>
    But now we knew that we were near<br>
    Our camp — the Paroo River.</p>

  <p>With blighted eyes and blistered feet,<br>
    With stomachs out of order,<br>
    Half-mad with flies and dust and heat<br>
    We'd crossed the Queensland border.<br>
    I longed to hear a stream go by<br>
    And see the circles quiver;<br>
    I longed to lay me down and die<br>
    That night on Paroo River.</p>

  <p>'Tis said the land out West is grand —<br>
    I do not care who says it —<br>
    It isn't even decent scrub,<br>
    Nor yet an honest desert;<br>
    It's plagued with flies, and broiling hot,<br>
    A curse is on it ever;<br>
    I really think that God forgot<br>
    The country round that river.</p>

  <p>My mate — a native of the land —<br>
    In fiery speech and vulgar,<br>
    Condemned the flies and cursed the sand,<br>
    And doubly damned the mulga.<br>
    He peered ahead, he peered about —<br>
    A bushman he, and clever —<br>
    Now mind you keep a sharp look-out;<br>
    'We must be near the river.'</p>

  <p>The "nose-bags" heavy on each chest<br>
    (God bless one kindly squatter!),<br>
    With grateful weight our hearts they pressed —<br>
    We only wanted water.<br>
    The sun was setting (in the west) <br>
    In colour like a liver —<br>
    We'd fondly hoped to camp and stay<br>
    That night by Paroo River.</p>

  <p>A cloud was on my mate's broad brow,<br>
    And once I heard him mutter:<br>
    'What price the good old Darling now? —<br>
    God bless that grand old gutter!"<br>
    And then he stopped and slowly said<br>
    In tones that made me shiver—<br>
    "It cannot well be on ahead,<br>
    <span class="ital">I think we've crossed the river.</span>"</p>

  <p>But soon we saw a strip of ground<br>
    Beside the track we followed—<br>
    No damper than the surface round,<br>
    But just a little hollowed.<br>
    His brow assumed a thoughtful frown —<br>
    This speech did he deliver:<br>
    "I wonder if we'd best go down<br>
    Or up the blessed river?"</p>

  <p>"But where," said I, " 's the blooming stream?'<br>
    And he replied, 'we're at it!"<br>
    I stood awhile, as in a dream,<br>
    "Great Scott!" I cried, "is that it?<br>
    Why, that is some old bridle—track!"<br>
    He chuckled, "Well, I never!<br>
    It's plain you've never been Out Back —<br>
    This is the Paroo River!"</p>

  <p>No place to camp — no spot of damp —<br>
    No moisture to be seen there;<br>
    If e'er there was it left no sign<br>
    That it had ever been there.<br>
    But ere the morn, with heart and soul<br>
    We'd cause to thank the Giver —<br>
    We found a muddy water-hole<br>
    Some ten miles down the river.</p>
