    It is stuffy in the steerage where the second-classers sleep,<br>
    For there's near a hundred for'ard, and they're stowed away like sheep, --<br>
    They are trav'lers for the most part in a straight 'n' honest path;<br>
    But their linen's rather scanty, an' there isn't any bath --<br>
    Stowed away like ewes and wethers that is shore 'n' marked 'n' draft.<br>
    But the shearers of the shearers always seem to travel aft;<br>
    In the cushioned cabins, aft,<br>
    With saloons 'n' smoke-rooms, aft --<br>
    There is sheets 'n' best of tucker for the first-salooners, aft.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our beef is just like scrapin's from the inside of a hide,<br>
    And the spuds were pulled too early, for they're mostly green inside;<br>
    But from somewhere back amidships there's a smell o' cookin' waft,<br>
    An' I'd give my earthly prospects for a real good tuck-out aft --<br>
    Ham an' eggs 'n' coffee, aft,<br>
    Say, cold fowl for luncheon, aft,<br>
    Juicy grills an' toast 'n' cutlets -- tucker a-lor-frongsy, aft.
  </p>

  <p>
    They feed our women sep'rate, an' they make a blessed fuss,<br>
    Just as if they couldn't trust 'em for to eat along with us!<br>
    Just because our hands are horny an' our hearts are rough with graft --<br>
    But the gentlemen and ladies always DINE together, aft --<br>
    With their ferns an' mirrors, aft,<br>
    With their flow'rs an' napkins, aft --<br>
    `I'll assist you to an orange' -- `Kindly pass the sugar', aft.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are shabby, rough, 'n' dirty, an' our feelin's out of tune,<br>
    An' it's hard on fellers for'ard that was used to go saloon;<br>
    There's a broken swell among us -- he is barracked, he is chaffed,<br>
    An' I wish at times, poor devil, for his own sake he was aft;<br>
    For they'd understand him, aft,<br>
    (He will miss the bath-rooms aft),<br>
    Spite of all there's no denyin' that there's finer feelin's aft.
  </p>

  <p>
    Last night we watched the moonlight as it spread across the sea --<br>
    `It is hard to make a livin',' said the broken swell to me.<br>
    `There is ups an' downs,' I answered, an' a bitter laugh he laughed --<br>
    There were brighter days an' better when he always travelled aft --<br>
    With his rug an' gladstone, aft,<br>
    With his cap an' spyglass, aft --<br>
    A careless, rovin', gay young spark as always travelled aft.
  </p>

  <p>
    There's a notice by the gangway, an' it seems to come amiss,<br>
    For it says that second-classers `ain't allowed abaft o' this';<br>
    An' there ought to be a notice for the fellows from abaft --<br>
    But the smell an' dirt's a warnin' to the first-salooners, aft;<br>
    With their tooth and nail-brush, aft,<br>
    With their cuffs 'n' collars, aft --<br>
    Their cigars an' books an' papers, an' their cap-peaks fore-'n'-aft.
  </p>

  <p>
    I want to breathe the mornin' breeze that blows against the boat,<br>
    For there's a swellin' in my heart -- a tightness in my throat --<br>
    We are for'ard when there's trouble! We are for'ard when there's graft!<br>
    But the men who never battle always seem to travel aft;<br>
    With their dressin'-cases, aft,<br>
    With their swell pyjamas, aft --<br>
    Yes! the idle and the careless, they have ease an' comfort, aft.
  </p>

  <p>
    I feel so low an' wretched, as I mooch about the deck,<br>
    That I'm ripe for jumpin' over -- an' I wish there was a wreck!<br>
    We are driven to New Zealand to be shot out over there --<br>
    Scarce a shillin' in our pockets, nor a decent rag to wear,<br>
    With the everlastin' worry lest we don't get into graft --<br>
    There is little left to land for if you cannot travel aft;<br>
    No anxiety abaft,<br>
    They have stuff to land with, aft --<br>
    Oh, there's little left to land for if you cannot travel aft;
  </p>

  <p>
    But it's grand at sea this mornin', an' Creation almost speaks,<br>
    Sailin' past the Bay of Islands with its pinnacles an' peaks,<br>
    With the sunny haze all round us an' the white-caps on the blue,<br>
    An' the orphan rocks an' breakers -- Oh, it's glorious sailin' through!<br>
    To the south a distant steamer, to the west a coastin' craft,<br>
    An' we see the beauty for'ard, better than if we were aft;<br>
    Spite of op'ra-glasses, aft;<br>
    But, ah well, they're brothers aft --<br>
    Nature seems to draw us closer -- bring us nearer fore-'n'-aft.
  </p>

  <p>
    What's the use of bein' bitter? What's the use of gettin' mad?<br>
    What's the use of bein' narrer just because yer luck is bad?<br>
    What's the blessed use of frettin' like a child that wants the moon?<br>
    There is broken hearts an' trouble in the gilded first saloon!<br>
    We are used to bein' shabby -- we have got no overdraft --<br>
    We can laugh at troubles for'ard that they couldn't laugh at aft;<br>
    Spite o' pride an' tone abaft<br>
    (Keepin' up appearance, aft)<br>
    There's anxiety an' worry in the breezy cabins aft.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the curse o' class distinctions from our shoulders shall be hurled,<br>
    An' the influence of woman revolutionize the world;<br>
    There'll be higher education for the toilin' starvin' clown,<br>
    An' the rich an' educated shall be educated down;<br>
    An' we all will meet amidships on this stout old earthly craft,<br>
    An' there won't be any friction 'twixt the classes fore-'n'-aft.<br>
    We'll be brothers, fore-'n'-aft!<br>
    Yes, an' sisters, fore-'n'-aft!<br>
    When the people work together, and there ain't no fore-'n'-aft.
