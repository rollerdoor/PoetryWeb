  <p>
    When you've come to make a fortune and you haven't made your salt,<br>
    And the reason of your failure isn't anybody's fault -<br>
    When you haven't got a billet, and the times are very slack,<br>
    There is nothing that can spur you like the shame of going back;<br>
    <span style="indent">Crawling home with empty pockets,<br>
      Going back hard-up;</span><br>
    Oh! it's then you learn the meaning of humiliation's cup.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the place and you are strangers and you struggle all alone,<br>
    And you have a mighty longing for the town where you are known;<br>
    When your clothes are very shabby and the future's very black,<br>
    There is nothing that can hurt you like the shame of going back.
  </p>

  <p>
    When we've fought the battle bravely and are beaten to the wall,<br>
    'Tis the sneers of men, not conscience, that make cowards of us all;<br>
    And the while you are returning, oh! your brain is on the rack,<br>
    And your heart is in the shadow of the shame of going back.
  </p>

  <p>
    When a beaten man's discovered with a bullet in his brain,<br>
    They POST-MORTEM him, and try him, and they say he was insane;<br>
    But it very often happens that he'd lately got the sack,<br>
    And his onward move was owing to the shame of going back.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ah! my friend, you call it nonsense, and your upper lip is curled,<br>
    I can see that you have never worked your passage through the world;<br>
    But when fortune rounds upon you and the rain is on the track,<br>
    You will learn the bitter meaning of the shame of going back;<br>
    <span class="indent">
      Going home with empty pockets,<br>
      Going home hard-up;<br>
    </span>
    Oh, you'll taste the bitter poison in humiliation's cup.
