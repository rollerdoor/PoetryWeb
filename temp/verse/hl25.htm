  <p>
    Said Grenfell to my spirit,
    "You've been writing very free<br>
    Of the charms of other places, and you don't remember me.<br>
    You have claimed another native place and think it's Nature's law,<br>
    Since you never paid a visit to a town you never saw:<br>
    So you sing of Mudgee Mountains, willowed stream and grassy flat:<br>
    But I put a charm upon you and you won't get over that."
  </p>

  <p>
    O said Grenfell to my spirit, " Though you write of breezy peaks,<br>
    Golden Gullies, wattle sidings, and the pools in she-oak creeks,<br>
    Of the place your kin were born in and the childhood that you knew,<br>
    And your father's distant Norway (though it has some claim on you),<br>
    Though you sing of dear old Mudgee and the home on Pipeclay Flat,<br>
    You were born on Grenfell goldfield â€“ and you can't get over that ."
