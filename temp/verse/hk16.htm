<div class="verse">
  <p>
    The song that once I dreamed about,<br>
    The tender, touching thing,<br>
    As radiant as the rose without,<br>
    The love of wind and wing:<br>
    The perfect verses, to the tune<br>
    Of woodland music set,<br>
    As beautiful as afternoon,<br>
    Remain unwritten yet.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is too late to write them now —<br>
    The ancient fire is cold;<br>
    No ardent lights illume the brow,<br>
    As in the days of old.<br>
    I cannot dream the dream again;<br>
    But, when the happy birds<br>
    Are singing in the sunny rain,<br>
    I think I hear its words.
  </p>

  <p>
    I think I hear the echo still<br>
    Of long-forgotten tones,<br>
    When evening winds are on the hill<br>
    And sunset fires the cones;<br>
    But only in the hours supreme,<br>
    With songs of land and sea,<br>
    The lyrics of the leaf and stream,<br>
    This echo comes to me.
  </p>

  <p>
    No longer doth the earth reveal<br>
    Her gracious green and gold;<br>
    I sit where youth was once, and feel<br>
    That I am growing old.<br>
    The lustre from the face of things<br>
    Is wearing all away;<br>
    Like one who halts with tired wings,<br>
    I rest and muse to-day.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is a river in the range<br>
    I love to think about;<br>
    Perhaps the searching feet of change<br>
    Have never found it out.<br>
    Ah! oftentimes I used to look<br>
    Upon its banks, and long<br>
    To steal the beauty of that brook<br>
    And put it in a song.
  </p>

  <p>
    I wonder if the slopes of moss,<br>
    In dreams so dear to me —<br>
    The falls of flower, and flower-like floss —<br>
    Are as they used to be!<br>
    I wonder if the waterfalls,<br>
    The singers far and fair,<br>
    That gleamed between the wet, green walls,<br>
    Are still the marvels there!
  </p>

  <p>
    Ah! let me hope that in that place<br>
    Those old familiar things<br>
    To which I turn a wistful face<br>
    Have never taken wings.<br>
    Let me retain the fancy still<br>
    That, past the lordly range,<br>
    There always shines, in folds of hill,<br>
    One spot secure from change!
  </p>

  <p>
    I trust that yet the tender screen<br>
    That shades a certain nook<br>
    Remains, with all its gold and green,<br>
    The glory of the brook.<br>
    It hides a secret to the birds<br>
    And waters only known:<br>
    The letters of two lovely words —<br>
    A poem on a stone.
  </p>

  <p>
    Perhaps the lady of the past<br>
    Upon these lines may light,<br>
    The purest verses, and the last,<br>
    That I may ever write:<br>
    She need not fear a word of blame:<br>
    Her tale the flowers keep —<br>
    The wind that heard me breathe her name<br>
    Has been for years asleep.
  </p>

  <p>
    But in the night, and when the rain<br>
    The troubled torrent fills,<br>
    I often think I see again<br>
    The river in the hills;<br>
    And when the day is very near,<br>
    And birds are on the wing,<br>
    My spirit fancies it can hear<br>
    The song I cannot sing.</font>
