    Faces in the Street

<div class="verse">
  <p>
    They lie, the men who tell us in a loud decisive tone<br>
    That want is here a stranger, and that misery's unknown;<br>
    For where the nearest suburb and the city proper meet<br>
    My window-sill is level with the faces in the street —<br>
    Drifting past, drifting past,<br>
    To the beat of weary feet —<br>
    While I sorrow for the owners of those faces in the street.
  </p>

  <p>
    And cause I have to sorrow, in a land so young and fair,<br>
    To see upon those faces stamped the marks of Want and Care;<br>
    I look in vain for traces of the fresh and fair and sweet<br>
    In sallow, sunken faces that are drifting through the street —<br>
    Drifting on, drifting on,<br>
    To the scrape of restless feet;<br>
    I can sorrow for the owners of the faces in the street.
  </p>

  <p>
    In hours before the dawning dims the starlight in the sky<br>
    The wan and weary faces first begin to trickle by,<br>
    Increasing as the moments hurry on with morning feet,<br>
    Till like a pallid river flow the faces in the street —<br>
    Flowing in, flowing in,<br>
    To the beat of hurried feet —<br>
    Ah! I sorrow for the owners of those faces in the street.
  </p>

  <p>
    The human river dwindles when 'tis past the hour of eight,<br>
    Its waves go flowing faster in the fear of being late;<br>
    But slowly drag the moments, whilst beneath the dust and heat<br>
    The city grinds the owners of the faces in the street —<br>
    Grinding body, grinding soul,<br>
    Yielding scarce enough to eat —<br>
    Oh! I sorrow for the owners of the faces in the street.
  </p>

  <p>
    And then the only faces till the sun is sinking down<br>
    Are those of outside toilers and the idlers of the town,<br>
    Save here and there a face that seems a stranger in the street,<br>
    Tells of the city's unemployed upon his weary beat —<br>
    Drifting round, drifting round,<br>
    To the tread of listless feet —<br>
    Ah! My heart aches for the owner of that sad face in the street.
  </p>

  <p>
    And when the hours on lagging feet have slowly dragged away,<br>
    And sickly yellow gaslights rise to mock the going day,<br>
    Then flowing past my window like a tide in its retreat,<br>
    Again I see the pallid stream of faces in the street —<br>
    Ebbing out, ebbing out,<br>
    To the drag of tired feet,<br>
    While my heart is aching dumbly for the faces in the street.
  </p>

  <p>
    And now all blurred and smirched with vice the day's sad pages end,<br>
    For while the short `large hours' toward the longer `small hours' trend,<br>
    With smiles that mock the wearer, and with words that half entreat,<br>
    Delilah pleads for custom at the corner of the street —<br>
    Sinking down, sinking down,<br>
    Battered wreck by tempests beat —<br>
    A dreadful, thankless trade is hers, that Woman of the Street.
  </p>

  <p>
    But, ah! to dreader things than these our fair young city comes,<br>
    For in its heart are growing thick the filthy dens and slums,<br>
    Where human forms shall rot away in sties for swine unmeet,<br>
    And ghostly faces shall be seen unfit for any street —<br>
    Rotting out, rotting out,<br>
    For the lack of air and meat —<br>
    In dens of vice and horror that are hidden from the street.
  </p>

  <p>
    I wonder would the apathy of wealthy men endure<br>
    Were all their windows level with the faces of the Poor?<br>
    Ah! Mammon's slaves, your knees shall knock, your hearts in terror beat,<br>
    When God demands a reason for the sorrows of the street,<br>
    The wrong things and the bad things<br>
    And the sad things that we meet<br>
    In the filthy lane and alley, and the cruel, heartless street.
  </p>

  <p>
    I left the dreadful corner where the steps are never still,<br>
    And sought another window overlooking gorge and hill;<br>
    But when the night came dreary with the driving rain and sleet,<br>
    They haunted me — the shadows of those faces in the street,<br>
    Flitting by, flitting by,<br>
    Flitting by with noiseless feet,<br>
    And with cheeks but little paler than the real ones in the street.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once I cried: `Oh, God Almighty! if Thy might doth still endure,<br>
    Now show me in a vision for the wrongs of Earth a cure.'<br>
    And, lo! with shops all shuttered I beheld a city's street,<br>
    And in the warning distance heard the tramp of many feet,<br>
    Coming near, coming near,<br>
    To a drum's dull distant beat,<br>
    And soon I saw the army that was marching down the street.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then, like a swollen river that has broken bank and wall,<br>
    The human flood came pouring with the red flags over all,<br>
    And kindled eyes all blazing bright with revolution's heat,<br>
    And flashing swords reflecting rigid faces in the street.<br>
    Pouring on, pouring on,<br>
    To a drum's loud threatening beat,<br>
    And the war-hymns and the cheering of the people in the street.
  </p>

  <p>
    And so it must be while the world goes rolling round its course,<br>
    The warning pen shall write in vain, the warning voice grow hoarse,<br>
    But not until a city feels Red Revolution's feet<br>
    Shall its sad people miss awhile the terrors of the street —<br>
    The dreadful everlasting strife<br>
    For scarcely clothes and meat<br>
    In that pent track of living death — the city's cruel street.
