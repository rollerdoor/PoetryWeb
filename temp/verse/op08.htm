  <p>
    A short time back while over in Vic.<br>
    I met with a chap called Post-Hole Mick;<br>
    He was a raw-boned, loose-built son of a paddy<br>
    And at putting down post-holes he was the daddy.
  </p>

  <p>
    And wherever you'd meet him, near or far,<br>
    He had always his long-handled shovel and bar —<br>
    I suppose you all know what I mean by a bar<br>
    Is a lump of wrought-iron the shape of a spar
  </p>

  <p>
    With one chisel-end for digging the ground<br>
    And average weight about twenty pound.<br>
    Mick worked for the cockies around Geelong,<br>
    For a time they kept him going strong.
  </p>

  <p>
    He would sink them a hundred holes for a bob,<br>
    And, of course, soon worked himself out of a job.<br>
    But when post-hole sinking got scarce for Mick<br>
    He greased his brogues and cut his stick.
  </p>

  <p>
    And one fine day he left Geelong<br>
    And took his shovel and bar along.<br>
    He took to the track in search of work,<br>
    And struck due north, en route to Bourke.
  </p>

  <p>
    It seems he had been some time on tramp<br>
    When one day he struck a fencers camp.<br>
    The contractor there was wanting a hand,<br>
    As post-hole sinkers were in demand.
  </p>

  <p>
    He showed him the line and put him on,<br>
    But while he looked round, shure Mick was gone —<br>
    There were the holes, but where was the man?<br>
    Then his eye along the line he ran.
  </p>

  <p>
    He'd already put down about ninety-nine,<br>
    And at the rate of a hunt he was running the line.<br>
    He had a few sinkers he thought was quick<br>
    Till the day he engaged with Post-Hole Mick.
  </p>

  <p>
    When he finished his contract Mick started forth,<br>
    And it appears kept his course due north<br>
    For I saw a report in the Croydon Star<br>
    Where a fellow had passed with a shovel and bar.
  </p>

  <p>
    To give you an idea of how he could walk<br>
    A day or two later he struck Cape York.<br>
    If they can't find him work there putting down holes<br>
    I'm afraid he'll arrive at one of the poles.
