    Oh! there once was a swagman camped in the Billabong,<br>
    Under the shade of a Coolabah tree;<br>
    And he sang as he looked at his old billy boiling,<br>
    "Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me."
  </p>

  <p>
    Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda, my darling,<br>
    Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?<br>
    Waltzing Matilda and leading a water-bag --<br>
    Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?
  </p>

  <p>
    Down came a jumbuck to drink at the water-hole,<br>
    Up jumped the swagman and grabbed him in glee;<br>
    And he sang as he put him away in his tucker-bag,<br>
    "You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me!"
  </p>

  <p>
    Down came the Squatter a-riding his thorough-bred;<br>
    Down came Policemen -- one, two, and three.<br>
    "Whose is the jumbuck you've got in the tucker-bag?<br>
    You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me."
  </p>

  <p>
    But the swagman, he up and he jumped in the water-hole,<br>
    Drowning himself by the Coolabah tree;<br>
    And his ghost may be heard as it sings in the Billabong,<br>
    "Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?"
  </p>
