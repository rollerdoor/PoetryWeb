    <p>
        It was somewhere up the country, in a land of rock and scrub,<br>
        That they formed an institution called the Geebung Polo Club.<br>
        They were long and wiry natives from the rugged mountain side,<br>
        And the horse was never saddled that the Geebungs couldn't ride;<br>
        But their style of playing polo was irregular and rash --<br>
        They had mighty little science, but a mighty lot of dash:<br>
        And they played on mountain ponies that were muscular and strong,<br>
        Though their coats were quite unpolished,<br>
        and their manes and tails were long.<br>
        And they used to train those ponies wheeling cattle in the scrub:<br>
        They were demons, were the members of the Geebung Polo Club.
    </p>

    <p>
        It was somewhere down the country, in a city's smoke and steam,<br>
        That a polo club existed, called `The Cuff and Collar Team'.<br>
        As a social institution 'twas a marvellous success,<br>
        For the members were distinguished by exclusiveness and dress.<br>
        They had natty little ponies that were nice, and smooth, and sleek,<br>
        For their cultivated owners only rode 'em once a week.<br>
        So they started up the country in pursuit of sport and fame,<br>
        For they meant to show the Geebungs how they ought to play the game;<br>
        And they took their valets with them -- just to give their boots a rub<br>
        Ere they started operations on the Geebung Polo Club.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now my readers can imagine how the contest ebbed and flowed,<br>
        When the Geebung boys got going it was time to clear the road;<br>
        And the game was so terrific that ere half the time was gone<br>
        A spectator's leg was broken -- just from merely looking on.<br>
        For they waddied one another till the plain was strewn with dead,<br>
        While the score was kept so even that they neither got ahead.<br>
        And the Cuff and Collar Captain, when he tumbled off to die,<br>
        Was the last surviving player -- so the game was called a tie.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then the Captain of the Geebungs raised him slowly from the ground,<br>
        Though his wounds were mostly mortal, yet he fiercely gazed around;<br>
        There was no one to oppose him -- all the rest were in a trance,<br>
        So he scrambled on his pony for his last expiring chance,<br>
        For he meant to make an effort to get victory to his side;<br>
        So he struck at goal -- and missed it -- then he tumbled off and died.
    </p>

    <p>*****</p>

    <p>
        By the old Campaspe River, where the breezes shake the grass,<br>
        There's a row of little gravestones that the stockmen never pass,<br>
        For they bear a crude inscription saying, `Stranger, drop a tear,<br>
        For the Cuff and Collar players and the Geebung boys lie here.'<br>
        And on misty moonlit evenings, while the dingoes howl around,<br>
        You can see their shadows flitting down that phantom polo ground;<br>
        You can hear the loud collisions as the flying players meet,<br>
        And the rattle of the mallets, and the rush of ponies' feet,<br>
        Till the terrified spectator rides like blazes to the pub --<br>
        He's been haunted by the spectres of the Geebung Polo Club.
