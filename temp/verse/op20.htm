  <p>
    Never give up, though life be a battle<br>
    Wherein true men may fail, and true causes be sold;<br>
    Yet, on the whole, however may rattle<br>
    The thunders of chance, scaring cowards like cattle —<br>
    Clear victory's always the bride of the bold.
  </p>

  <p>
    Armed in your right-though friendship deny you,<br>
    And love fall away when the storm's at the worst,<br>
    Count not your loss, Was destined to try you —<br>
    Bear the brunt like a man, and your deeds shall ally you<br>
    To natures more noble and true than the first.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rail not at Fate : if rightly you scan her,<br>
    There's none loves more strongly the heart that endures:<br>
    On, in the hero's calm resolute manner,<br>
    Still bear aloft your hope's long-trusted banner,<br>
    And the day, if you do but live through it, is yours.
  </p>

  <p>
    Be this your faith; and if killing strokes clatter<br>
    On your harness where true men before you have died,<br>
    Fight on, let your life-blood be poured out like water —<br>
    Fight on, make at least a brave end of the matter,<br>
    Brave end of the struggle if nothing beside.
