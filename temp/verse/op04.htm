  <p>
    This is not sorrow, this is work: <br>
    I build A cairn of words over a silent man,<br>
    My friend John Learmonth whom the Germans killed.
  </p>

  <p>
    There was no word of hero in his plan;<br>
    Verse should have been his love and peace his trade, <br>
    But history turned him to a partisan.
  </p>

  <p>
    Far from the battle as his bones are laid <br>
    Crete will remember him. Remember well, <br>
    Mountains of Crete, the Second Field Brigade!
  </p>

  <p>
    Say Crete, and there is little more to tell <br>
    Of muddle tall as treachery, despair<br>
    And black defeat resounding like a bell;
  </p>
  <p>
    But bring the magnifying focus near<br>
    And in contempt of muddle and defeat<br>
    The old heroic virtues still appear.
  </p>

  <p>
    Australian blood where hot and icy meet <br>
    (James Hogg and Lermontov were of his kin) <br>
    Lie still and fertilise the fields of Crete.
  </p>

  <p>
    Schoolboy, I watched his ballading begin:<br>
    Billy and bullocky and billabong,<br>
    Our properties of childhood, all were in.
  </p>

  <p>
    I heard the air though not the undersong, <br>
    The fierceness and resolve; but all the same <br>
    They're the tradition, and tradition's strong.
  </p>

  <p>
    Swagman and bushranger die hard, die game, <br>
    Die fighting, like that wild colonial boy â€“ <br>
    Jack Dowling, says the ballad, was his name.
  </p>

  <p>
    He also spun his pistol like a toy,<br>
    Turned to the hills like wolf or kangaroo,<br>
    And faced destruction with a bitter joy.
  </p>

  <p>
    His freedom gave him nothing else to do <br>
    But set his back against his family tree<br>
    And fight the better for the fact he knew
  </p>

  <p>
    He was as good as dead. Because the sea <br>
    Was closed and the air dark and the land lost, <br>
    'They'll never capture me alive,' said he.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's courage chemically pure, uncrossed <br>
    With sacrifice or duty or career,<br>
    Which counts and pays in ready coin the cost
  </p>

  <p>
    Of holding course. Armies are not its sphere <br>
    Where all's contrived to achieve its counterfeit; <br>
    It swears with discipline, it's volunteer.
  </p>

  <p>
    I could as hardly make a moral fit<br>
    Around it as around a lightning flash.<br>
    There is no moral, that's the point of it,
  </p>

  <p>
    No moral. But I'm glad of this panache<br>
    That sparkles, as from flint, from us and steel, <br>
    True to no crown nor presidential sash
  </p>

  <p>
    Nor flag nor fame. Let others mourn and feel <br>
    He died for nothing: nothings have their place. <br>
    While thus the kind and civilised conceal
  </p>

  <p>
    This spring of unsuspected inward grace <br>
    And look on death as equals, I am filled<br>
    With queer affection for the human race.
