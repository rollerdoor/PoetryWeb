<div class="verse">
  <p>
    Towards the hills of Jamberoo<br>
    Some few fantastic shadows haste,<br>
    Uplit with fires<br>
    Like castle spires<br>
    Outshining through a mirage waste.<br>
    Behold, a mournful glory sits<br>
    On feathered ferns and woven brakes,<br>
    Where sobbing wild like restless child<br>
    The gusty breeze of evening wakes!<br>
    Methinks I hear on every breath<br>
    A lofty tone go passing by,<br>
    That whispers — "Weave,<br>
    Though wood winds grieve,<br>
    The fadeless blooms of Poesy!"
  </p>

  <p>
    A spirit hand has been abroad —<br>
    An evil hand to pluck the flowers —<br>
    A world of wealth,<br>
    And blooming health<br>
    Has gone from fragrant seaside bowers.<br>
    The twilight waxeth dim and dark,<br>
    The sad waves mutter sounds of woe,<br>
    But the evergreen retains its sheen,<br>
    And happy hearts exist below;<br>
    But pleasure sparkles on the sward,<br>
    And voices utter words of bliss,<br>
    And while my bride<br>
    Sits by my side,<br>
    Oh, where's the scene surpassing this?
  </p>

  <p>
    Kiama slumbers, robed with mist,<br>
    All glittering in the dewy light<br>
    That, brooding o'er<br>
    The shingly shore,<br>
    Lies resting in the arms of Night;<br>
    And foam-flecked crags with surges chill,<br>
    And rocks embraced of cold-lipped spray,<br>
    Are moaning loud where billows crowd<br>
    In angry numbers up the bay.<br>
    The holy stars come looking down<br>
    On windy heights and swarthy strand,<br>
    And Life and Love —<br>
    The cliffs above —<br>
    Are sitting fondly hand in hand.
  </p>

  <p>
    I hear a music inwardly,<br>
    That floods my soul with thoughts of joy;<br>
    Within my heart<br>
    Emotions start<br>
    That Time may still but ne'er destroy.<br>
    An ancient Spring revives itself,<br>
    And days which made the past divine;<br>
    And rich warm gleams from golden dreams,<br>
    All glorious in their summer shine;<br>
    And songs of half forgotten hours,<br>
    And many a sweet melodious strain,<br>
    Which still shall rise<br>
    Beneath the skies<br>
    When all things else have died again.
  </p>

  <p>
    A white sail glimmers out at sea —<br>
    A vessel walking in her sleep;<br>
    Some Power goes past<br>
    That bends the mast,<br>
    While frighted waves to leeward leap.<br>
    The moonshine veils the naked sand<br>
    And ripples upward with the tide,<br>
    As underground there rolls a sound<br>
    From where the caverned waters glide.<br>
    A face that bears affection's glow,<br>
    The soul that speaks from gentle eyes,<br>
    And joy which slips<br>
    From loving lips<br>
    Have made this spot my Paradise!
