  <p>
    When you're lying in your hammock, sleeping soft and sleeping sound,<br>
    Without a care or trouble on your mind,<br>
    And there's nothing to disturb you but the engines going round,<br>
    And you're dreaming of the girl you left behind;<br>
    In the middle of your joys you'll be wakened by a noise,<br>
    And a clatter on the deck above your crown,<br>
    And you'll hear the corporal shout as he turns the picket out,<br>
    `There's another blessed horse fell down.'
  </p>

  <p>
    You can see 'em in the morning, when you're cleaning out the stall,<br>
    A-leaning on the railings nearly dead,<br>
    And you reckon by the evening they'll be pretty sure to fall,<br>
    And you curse them as you tumble into bed.<br>
    Oh, you'll hear it pretty soon, `Pass the word for Denny Moon,<br>
    There's a horse here throwing handsprings like a clown;<br>
    And it's `Shove the others back or he'll cripple half the pack,<br>
    There's another blessed horse fell down.'
  </p>

  <p>
    when the war is over and the fighting all is done,<br>
    And you're all at home with medals on your chest,<br>
    And you've learnt to sleep so soundly that the firing of a gun<br>
    At your bedside wouldn't rob you of your rest;<br>
    As you lie in slumber deep, if your wife walks in her sleep,<br>
    And tumbles down the stairs and breaks her crown,<br>
    Oh, it won't awaken you, for you'll say, `It's nothing new,<br>
    It's another blessed horse fell down.'
