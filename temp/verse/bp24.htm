    "Only a pound," said the auctioneer,<br>
    "Only a pound; and I'm standing here<br>
    Selling this animal, gain or loss --<br>
    Only a pound for the drover's horse?<br>
    One of the sort that was ne'er afraid,<br>
    One of the boys of the Old Brigade;<br>
    Thoroughly honest and game, I'll swear,<br>
    Only a little the worse for wear;<br>
    Plenty as bad to be seen in town,<br>
    Give me a bid and I'll knock him down;<br>
    Sold as he stands, and without recourse,<br>
    Give me a bid for the drover's horse."
  </p>

  <p>
    Loitering there in an aimless way<br>
    Somehow I noticed the poor old grey,<br>
    Weary and battered and screwed, of course;<br>
    Yet when I noticed the old grey horse,<br>
    The rough bush saddle, and single rein<br>
    Of the bridle laid on his tangled mane,<br>
    Straighway the crowd and the auctioneer<br>
    Seemed on a sudden to disappear,<br>
    Melted away in a kind if haze --<br>
    For my heart went back to the droving days.
  </p>

  <p>
    Back to the road, and I crossed again<br>
    Over the miles of the saltbush plain --<br>
    The shining plain that is said to be<br>
    The dried-up bed of an inland sea.<br>
    Where the air so dry and so clear and bright<br>
    Refracts the sun with a wondrous light,<br>
    And out in the dim horizon makes<br>
    The deep blue gleam of the phantom lakes.
  </p>

  <p>
    At dawn of day we could feel the breeze<br>
    That stirred the boughs of the sleeping trees,<br>
    And brought a breath of the fragrance rare<br>
    That comes and goes in that scented air;<br>
    For the trees and grass and the shrubs contain<br>
    A dry sweet scent on the saltbush plain.<br>
    for those that love it and understand<br>
    The saltbush plain is a wonderland,<br>
    A wondrous country, were Nature's ways<br>
    Were revealed to me in the droving days.
  </p>

  <p>
    We saw the fleet wild horses pass,<br>
    And kangaroos through the Mitchell grass;<br>
    The emu ran with her frightened brood<br>
    All unmolested and unpursued.<br>
    But there rose a shout and a wild hubbub<br>
    When the dingo raced for his native scrub,<br>
    And he paid right dear for his stolen meals<br>
    With the drovers' dogs at his wretched heels.<br>
    For we ran him down at a rattling pace,<br>
    While the pack-horse joined in the stirring chase.<br>
    And a wild halloo at the kill we'd raise --<br>
    We were light of heart in the droving days.
  </p>

  <p>
    'Twas a drover's horse, and my hand again<br>
    Made a move to close on a fancied rein.<br>
    For I felt a swing and the easy stride<br>
    Of the grand old horse that I used to ride.<br>
    In drought or plenty, in good or ill,<br>
    The same old steed was my comrade still;<br>
    The old grey horse with his honest ways<br>
    Was a mate to me in the droving days.
  </p>

  <p>
    When we kept our watch in the cold and damp,<br>
    If the cattle broke from the sleeping camp,<br>
    Over the flats and across the plain,<br>
    With my head bent down on his waving mane,<br>
    Through the boughs above and the stumps below,<br>
    On the darkest night I could let him go<br>
    At a racing speed; he would choose his course,<br>
    And my life was safe with the old grey horse.<br>
    But man and horse had a favourite job, <br>
    When an outlaw broke from the station mob;<br>
    With a right good will was the stockwhip plied,<br>
    As the old horse raced at the straggler's side,<br>
    And the greenhide whip such a weal would raise --<br>
    We could use the whip in the droving days.
  </p>

  <p> <span class="center">*****</span> </p>

  <p>
    "Only a pound!" and was this the end --<br>
    Only a pound for the drover's friend.<br>
    The drover's friend that has seen his day,<br>
    And now was worthless and cast away<br>
    With a broken knee and a broken heart<br>
    To be flogged and starved in a hawker's cart.<br>
    Well, I made a bid for a sense of shame<br>
    And the memories of the good old game.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Thank you? Guinea! and cheap at that!<br>
    Against you there in the curly hat!<br>
    Only a guinea, and one more chance,<br>
    Down he goes if there's no advance,<br>
    Third, and last time, one! two! three!"<br>
    And the old grey horse was knocked down to me.<br>
    And now he's wandering, fat and sleek,<br>
    On the lucerne flats by the Homestead Creek;<br>
    I dare not ride him for fear he's fall,<br>
    But he does a journey to beat them all,<br>
    For though he scarcely a trot can raise,<br>
    He can take me back to the droving days.
