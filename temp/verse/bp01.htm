  <p>
    On the outer Barcoo where the churches are few,<br>
    And men of religion are scanty,<br>
    On a road never cross'd 'cept by folk that are lost,<br>
    One Michael Magee had a shanty.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now this Mike was the dad of a ten year old lad,<br>
    Plump, healthy, and stoutly conditioned;<br>
    He was strong as the best, but poor Mike had no rest<br>
    For the youngster had never been christened
  </p>

  <p>
    And his wife used to cry, `If the darlin' should die<br>
    Saint Peter would not recognise him.'<br>
    But by luck he survived till a preacher arrived,<br>
    Who agreed straightaway to baptise him.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now the artful young rogue, while they held their collogue,<br>
    With his ear to the keyhole was listenin',<br>
    And he muttered in fright, while his features turned white,<br>
    `What the divil and all is this christenin'?'
  </p>

  <p>
    He was none of your dolts, he had seen them brand colts,<br>
    And it seemed to his small understanding,<br>
    If the man in the frock made him one of the flock,<br>
    It must mean something very like branding.
  </p>

  <p>
    So away with a rush he set off for the bush,<br>
    While the tears in his eyelids they glistened —<br>
    `'Tis outrageous,' says he, `to brand youngsters like me,<br>
    I'll be dashed if I'll stop to be christened!'
  </p>

  <p>
    Like a young native dog he ran into a log,<br>
    And his father with language uncivil,<br>
    Never heeding the `praste' cried aloud in his haste,<br>
    `Come out and be christened, you divil!'
  </p>

  <p>
    But he lay there as snug as a bug in a rug,<br>
    And his parents in vain might reprove him,<br>
    Till his reverence spoke (he was fond of a joke)<br>
    `I've a notion,' says he, `that'll move him.'
  </p>

  <p>
    `Poke a stick up the log, give the spalpeen a prog;<br>
    Poke him aisy — don't hurt him or maim him,<br>
    'Tis not long that he'll stand, I've the water at hand,<br>
    As he rushes out this end I'll name him.
  </p>

  <p>
    `Here he comes, and for shame! ye've forgotten the name —<br>
    Is it Patsy or Michael or Dinnis?'<br>
    Here the youngster ran out, and the priest gave a shout —<br>
    `Take your chance, anyhow, wid `Maginnis'!'
  </p>

  <p>
    As the howling young cub ran away to the scrub<br>
    Where he knew that pursuit would be risky,<br>
    The priest, as he fled, flung a flask at his head<br>
    That was labelled `MAGINNIS'S WHISKY'!
  </p>

  <p>
    And Maginnis Magee has been made a J.P.,<br>
    And the one thing he hates more than sin is<br>
    To be asked by the folk, who have heard of the joke,<br>
    How he came to be christened `Maginnis'!
