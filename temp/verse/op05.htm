    A peaceful spot is Piper's Flat. The folk that live around -<br>
    They keep themselves by keeping sheep and turning up the ground;<br>
    But the climate is erratic, and the consequences are<br>
    The struggle with the elements is everlasting war.<br>
    We plough, and sow, and harrow-then sit down and pray for rain;<br>
    And then we all get flooded out and have to start again.<br>
    But the folk are now rejoicing as they ne'er rejoiced before ,<br>
    For we've played Molongo cricket, and McDougal topped the score!
  </p>

  <p>
    Molongo had a head on it, and challenged us to play<br>
    A single-innings match for lunch-the losing team to pay.<br>
    We were not great guns at cricket, but we couldn't well say no,<br>
    So we all began to practice, and we let the reaping go,<br>
    We scoured the Flat for ten miles round to muster up our men,<br>
    But when the list was totaled we could only number ten.<br>
    Then up spoke big Tim Brady: he was always slow to speak<br>
    And he said "What price McDougal, who lives down at Cooper's Creek?"
  </p>

  <p>
    So we sent for old McDougal, and he stated in reply<br>
    That he d never played at cricket but he'd half a mind to try.<br>
    He couldn't come to practice -he was getting in his hay,<br>
    But he guessed he'd show the beggars from Molongo how to play.<br>
    Now, McDougal was a Scotchman, and a canny one at that<br>
    So he started in to practice with a paling for a bat.<br>
    He got Mrs Mac to bowl to him, but she couldn't run at all ,<br>
    So he trained his sheep-dog, Pincher, how to scout and fetch the ball.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, Pincher was no puppy; he was old, and worn, and gray ;<br>
    But he understood McDougal, and-accustomed to obey.<br>
    When McDougal cried out "Fetch it!" he would fetch it in a trice,<br>
    But, until the word was "Drop it!" he would grip it like a vice.<br>
    And each succeeding night they played until the light grew dim:<br>
    Sometimes McDougal struck the ball-sometimes the ball struck him.<br>
    Each time he struck, the ball would plough a furrow in the ground;<br>
    And when he missed, the impetus would turn him three times round.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fatal day at length arrived - the day that was to see<br>
    Molongo bite the dust, or Piper's Flat knocked up a tree!<br>
    Molongo's captain won the toss, and sent his men to bat<br>
    And they gave some leather-hunting to the men of Piper's Flat.<br>
    When the ball sped where McDougal stood, firm planted in his track,<br>
    He shut his eyes, and turned him round, and stopped it-with his back!<br>
    The highest score was twenty-two, the total sixty-six,<br>
    When Brady sent a yorker down that scattered. Johnson's sticks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then Piper's Flat went in to bat, for glory and renown,<br>
    But, like the grass before the scythe, our wickets tumbled down.<br>
    "Nine wickets down for seventeen, with fifty more to win!"<br>
    Our captain heaved a heavy sigh, and sent McDougal in.<br>
    "Ten pounds to one you'll lose it!" cried a barracker from town ;<br>
    But McDougal said, "I'll tak it, mon and planked the money down.<br>
    Then he girded up his moleskins in a self-reliant style,<br>
    Threw off his hat and boots and faced the bowler with a smile.
  </p>

  <p>
    He held the bat the wrong side out, and Johnson with a grin<br>
    Stepped lightly to the bowling crease, and sent a "wobbler" in;<br>
    McDougal spooned it softly back, and Johnson waited there,<br>
    But McDougal, crying "Fetch it!" started running like a hare.<br>
    Molongo shouted "Victory! He's out as sure as eggs,"<br>
    When Pincher started through the crowd, and ran through Johnson's legs.<br>
    He seized the ball like lightning; then he ran behind a log,<br>
    And McDougal kept on running, while Molongo chased the dog!
  </p>

  <p>
    They chased him up, they chased him down, they chased him round, and then<br>
    He darted through the slip-rail as the scorer shouted "Ten!"<br>
    McDougal puffed; Molongo swore; excitement was intense;<br>
    As the scorer marked down twenty, Pincher cleared a barbed-wire fence.<br>
    "Let us head him!" shrieked Molongo. "Brain the mongrel with a bat!"<br>
    "Run it out! Good old McDougal!" yelled the men of Piper's Flat.<br>
    And McDougal kept on jogging, and then Pincher doubled back,<br>
    And the scorer counted "Forty" as they raced across the track.
  </p>

  <p>
    McDougal's legs were going fast, Molongo's breath was gone<br>
    But still Molongo chased the dog-McDougal struggled on.<br>
    When the scorer shouted "Fifty" then they knew the chase could cease;<br>
    And McDougal gasped out "Drop it!" as he dropped within his crease.<br>
    Then Pincher dropped the ball, and as instinctively he knew<br>
    Discretion was the wiser plan, he disappeared from view;<br>
    And as Molongo's beaten men exhausted lay around<br>
    We raised McDougal shoulder-high, and bore him from the ground.
  </p>

  <p>
    We bore him to McGinniss's, where lunch was ready laid,<br>
    And filled him up with whisky-punch, for which Molongo paid.<br>
    We drank his health in bumpers and we cheered him three times three,<br>
    And when Molongo got its breath Molongo joined the spree.<br>
    And the critics say they never saw a cricket match like that,<br>
    When McDougal broke the record in the game at Piper's Flat;<br>
    And the folk are jubilating as they never did before;<br>
    For we played Molongo cricket-and McDougal topped the score!
