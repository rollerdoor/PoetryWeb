  <p>
    The night too quickly passes<br>
    And we are growing old,<br>
    So let us fill our glasses<br>
    And toast the Days of Gold;<br>
    When finds of wondrous treasure<br>
    Set all the South ablaze,<br>
    And you and I were faithful mates<br>
    All through the roaring days!
  </p>

  <p>
    Then stately ships came sailing<br>
    From every harbour's mouth,<br>
    And sought the land of promise<br>
    That beaconed in the South;<br>
    Then southward streamed their streamers<br>
    And swelled their canvas full<br>
    To speed the wildest dreamers<br>
    E'er borne in vessel's hull.
  </p>

  <p>
    Their shining Eldorado,<br>
    Beneath the southern skies,<br>
    Was day and night for ever<br>
    Before their eager eyes.<br>
    The brooding bush, awakened,<br>
    Was stirred in wild unrest,<br>
    And all the year a human stream<br>
    Went pouring to the West.
  </p>

  <p>
    The rough bush roads re-echoed<br>
    The bar-room's noisy din,<br>
    When troops of stalwart horsemen<br>
    Dismounted at the inn.<br>
    And oft the hearty greetings<br>
    And hearty clasp of hands<br>
    Would tell of sudden meetings<br>
    Of friends from other lands;
  </p>

  <p>
    And when the cheery camp-fire<br>
    Explored the bush with gleams,<br>
    The camping-grounds were crowded<br>
    With caravans of teams;<br>
    Then home the jests were driven,<br>
    And good old songs were sung,<br>
    And choruses were given<br>
    The strength of heart and lung.
  </p>

  <p>
    Oft when the camps were dreaming,<br>
    And fires began to pale,<br>
    Through rugged ranges gleaming<br>
    Swept on the Royal Mail.<br>
    Behind six foaming horses,<br>
    And lit by flashing lamps,<br>
    Old Cobb and Co., in royal state,<br>
    Went dashing past the camps.
  </p>

  <p>
    Oh, who would paint a goldfield,<br>
    And paint the picture right,<br>
    As we have often seen it<br>
    In early morning's light;<br>
    The yellow mounds of mullock<br>
    With spots of red and white,<br>
    The scattered quartz that glistened<br>
    Like diamonds in light;
  </p>

  <p>
    The azure line of ridges,<br>
    The bush of darkest green,<br>
    The little homes of calico<br>
    That dotted all the scene.<br>
    The flat straw hats, with ribands,<br>
    That old engravings show --<br>
    The dress that still reminds us <br>
    Of sailors long ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    I hear the fall of timber<br>
    From distant flats and fells,<br>
    The pealing of the anvils<br>
    As clear as little bells,<br>
    The rattle of the cradle,<br>
    The clack of windlass-boles,<br>
    The flutter of the crimson flags<br>
    Above the golden holes.
  </p>

  <p>******</p>

  <p>
    Ah, then their hearts were bolder,<br>
    And if Dame Fortune frowned<br>
    Their swags they'd lightly shoulder<br>
    And tramp to other ground.<br>
    Oh, they were lion-hearted<br>
    Who gave our country birth!<br>
    Stout sons, of stoutest fathers born,<br>
    From all the lands on earth!
  </p>

  <p>Those golden days are vanished,<br>
    And altered is the scene;<br>
    The diggings are deserted,<br>
    The camping-grounds are green;<br>
    The flaunting flag of progress<br>
    Is in the West unfurled,<br>
    The mighty bush with iron rails<br>
    Is tethered to the world.
