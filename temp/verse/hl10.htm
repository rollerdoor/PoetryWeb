  <p>
    The colours of the setting sun<br>
    Withdrew across the Western land —<br>
    He raised the sliprails, one by one,<br>
    And shot them home with trembling hand; <br>
    Her brown hands clung — her face grew pale —<br>
    Ah! quivering chin and eyes that brim! — <br>
    One quick, fierce kiss across the rail,<br>
    And, "Good-bye, Mary!" "Good-bye, Jim!"</p>

  <p>Oh, he rides hard to race the pain<br>
    Who rides from love, who rides from home; <br>
    But he rides slowly home again,<br>
    Whose heart has learnt to love and roam.</p>

  <p>A hand upon the horse's mane,<br>
    And one foot in the stirrup set,<br>
    And, stooping back to kiss again,<br>
    With "Good-bye, Mary! don't you fret! <br>
    When I come back" — he laughed for her —<br>
    "We do not know how soon 'twill be; <br>
    I'll whistle as I round the spur —<br>
    You let the sliprails down for me."</p>

  <p>She gasped for sudden loss of hope,<br>
    As, with a backward wave to her,<br>
    He cantered down the grassy slope<br>
    And swiftly round the darkening spur. <br>
    Black-pencilled panels standing high,<br>
    And darkness fading into stars,<br>
    And, blurring fast against the sky,<br>
    A faint white form beside the bars.</p>

  <p>And often at the set of sun,<br>
    In winter bleak and summer brown, <br>
    She'd steal across the little run,<br>
    And shyly let the sliprails down, <br>
    And listen there when darkness shut<br>
    The nearer spur in silence deep, <br>
    And when they called her from the hut<br>
    Steal home and cry herself to sleep.</p>

  <p>*****</p>

  <p>And he rides hard to dull the pain<br>
    Who rides from one that loves him best... <br>
    And he rides slowly back again,<br>
    Whose restless heart must rove for rest.</p>
