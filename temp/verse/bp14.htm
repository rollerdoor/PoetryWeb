  <p>
    There was movement at the station, for the word had passed around<br>
    That the colt from old Regret had got away,<br>
    And had joined the wild bush horses, he was worth a thousand pound,<br>
    So all the cracks had gathered to the fray.<br>
    All the tried and noted riders from the stations near and far<br>
    Had mustered at the homestead overnight,<br>
    For the bushmen love hard riding where the wild bush horses are,<br>
    And the stock-horse snuffs the battle with delight.
  </p>

  <p>
    There was Harrison, who made his pile when Pardon won the cup,<br>
    The old man with his hair as white as snow;<br>
    But few could ride beside him when his blood was fairly up,<br>
    He would go wherever horse and man could go.<br>
    And Clancy of the Overflow came down to lend a hand,<br>
    No better horseman ever held the reins;<br>
    For never horse could throw him while the saddle-girths would stand,<br>
    He learnt to ride while droving on the plains.
  </p>

  <p>
    And one was there, a stripling on a small and weedy beast,<br>
    He was something like a racehorse undersized,<br>
    With a touch of Timor pony, three parts thoroughbred at least,<br>
    And such as are by mountain horsemen prized.<br>
    He was hard and tough and wiry, just the sort that won't say die<br>
    There was courage in his quick impatient tread;<br>
    And he bore the badge of gameness in his bright and fiery eye,<br>
    And the proud and lofty carriage of his head.
  </p>

  <p>
    But still so slight and weedy, one would doubt his power to stay,<br>
    And the old man said, `That horse will never do<br>
    For a long and tiring gallop, lad, you'd better stop away,<br>
    Those hills are far too rough for such as you.'<br>
    So he waited sad and wistful, only Clancy stood his friend,<br>
    `I think we ought to let him come,' he said;<br>
    `I warrant he'll be with us when he's wanted at the end,<br>
    For both his horse and he are mountain bred.
  </p>

  <p>
    `He hails from Snowy River, up by Kosciusko's side,<br>
    Where the hills are twice as steep and twice as rough,<br>
    Where a horse's hoofs strike firelight from the flint stones every stride,<br>
    The man that holds his own is good enough.<br>
    And the Snowy River riders on the mountains make their home,<br>
    Where the river runs those giant hills between;<br>
    I have seen full many horsemen since I first commenced to roam,<br>
    But nowhere yet such horsemen have I seen.'
  </p>

  <p>
    So he went, they found the horses by the big mimosa clump,<br>
    They raced away towards the mountain's brow,<br>
    And the old man gave his orders, `Boys, go at them from the jump,<br>
    No use to try for fancy riding now.<br>
    And, Clancy, you must wheel them, try and wheel them to the right.<br>
    Ride boldly, lad, and never fear the spills,<br>
    For never yet was rider that could keep the mob in sight,<br>
    If once they gain the shelter of those hills.'
  </p>

  <p>
    So Clancy rode to wheel them, he was racing on the wing<br>
    Where the best and boldest riders take their place,<br>
    And he raced his stock-horse past them, and he made the ranges ring<br>
    With the stockwhip, as he met them face to face.<br>
    Then they halted for a moment, while he swung the dreaded lash,<br>
    But they saw their well-loved mountain full in view,<br>
    And they charged beneath the stockwhip with a sharp and sudden dash,<br>
    And off into the mountain scrub they flew.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then fast the horsemen followed, where the gorges deep and black<br>
    Resounded to the thunder of their tread,<br>
    And the stockwhips woke the echoes, and they fiercely answered back<br>
    From cliffs and crags that beetled overhead.<br>
    And upward, ever upward, the wild horses held their way,<br>
    Where mountain ash and kurrajong grew wide;<br>
    And the old man muttered fiercely, `We may bid the mob good day,<br>
    NO man can hold them down the other side.'
  </p>

  <p>
    When they reached the mountain's summit, even Clancy took a pull,<br>
    It well might make the boldest hold their breath,<br>
    The wild hop scrub grew thickly, and the hidden ground was full<br>
    Of wombat holes, and any slip was death.<br>
    But the man from Snowy River let the pony have his head,<br>
    And he swung his stockwhip round and gave a cheer,<br>
    And he raced him down the mountain like a torrent down its bed,<br>
    While the others stood and watched in very fear.
  </p>

  <p>
    He sent the flint stones flying, but the pony kept his feet,<br>
    He cleared the fallen timber in his stride,<br>
    And the man from Snowy River never shifted in his seat,<br>
    It was grand to see that mountain horseman ride.<br>
    Through the stringy barks and saplings, on the rough and broken ground,<br>
    Down the hillside at a racing pace he went;<br>
    And he never drew the bridle till he landed safe and sound,<br>
    At the bottom of that terrible descent.
  </p>

  <p>
    He was right among the horses as they climbed the further hill,<br>
    And the watchers on the mountain standing mute,<br>
    Saw him ply the stockwhip fiercely, he was right among them still,<br>
    As he raced across the clearing in pursuit.<br>
    Then they lost him for a moment, where two mountain gullies met<br>
    In the ranges, but a final glimpse reveals<br>
    On a dim and distant hillside the wild horses racing yet,<br>
    With the man from Snowy River at their heels.
  </p>

  <p>
    And he ran them single-handed till their sides were white with foam.<br>
    He followed like a bloodhound on their track,<br>
    Till they halted cowed and beaten, then he turned their heads for home,<br>
    And alone and unassisted brought them back.<br>
    But his hardy mountain pony he could scarcely raise a trot,<br>
    He was blood from hip to shoulder from the spur;<br>
    But his pluck was still undaunted, and his courage fiery hot,<br>
    For never yet was mountain horse a cur.
  </p>

  <p>
    And down by Kosciusko, where the pine-clad ridges raise<br>
    Their torn and rugged battlements on high,<br>
    Where the air is clear as crystal, and the white stars fairly blaze<br>
    At midnight in the cold and frosty sky,<br>
    And where around the Overflow the reedbeds sweep and sway<br>
    To the breezes, and the rolling plains are wide,<br>
    The man from Snowy River is a household word to-day,<br>
    And the stockmen tell the story of his ride.
