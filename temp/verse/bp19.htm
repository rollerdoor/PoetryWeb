<div class="verse">
  <p>
    I bought a run a while ago,<br>
    On country rough and ridgy,<br>
    Where wallaroos and wombats grow --<br>
    The Upper Murrumbidgee.<br>
    The grass is rather scant, it's true,<br>
    But this a fair exchange is,<br>
    The sheep can see a lovely view<br>
    By climbing up the ranges.
  </p>

  <p>
    And She-oak Flat's the station's name,<br>
    I'm not surprised at that, sirs:<br>
    The oaks were there before I came,<br>
    And I supplied the flat, sirs.<br>
    A man would wonder how it's done,<br>
    The stock so soon decreases --<br>
    They sometimes tumble off the run<br>
    And break themselves to pieces.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've tried to make expenses meet,<br>
    But wasted all my labours,<br>
    The sheep the dingoes didn't eat<br>
    Were stolen by the neighbours.<br>
    They stole my pears -- my native pears --<br>
    Those thrice-convicted felons,<br>
    And ravished from me unawares<br>
    My crop of paddy-melons.
  </p>

  <p>
    And sometimes under sunny skies,<br>
    Without an explanation,<br>
    The Murrumbidgee used to rise<br>
    And overflow the station.<br>
    But this was caused (as now I know)<br>
    When summer sunshine glowing<br>
    Had melted all Kiandra's snow<br>
    And set the river going.
  </p>

  <p>
    And in the news, perhaps you read:<br>
    `Stock passings. Puckawidgee,<br>
    Fat cattle: Seven hundred head<br>
    Swept down the Murrumbidgee;<br>
    Their destination's quite obscure,<br>
    But, somehow, there's a notion,<br>
    Unless the river falls, they're sure<br>
    To reach the Southern Ocean.'
  </p>

  <p>
    So after that I'll give it best;<br>
    No more with Fate I'll battle.<br>
    I'll let the river take the rest,<br>
    For those were all my cattle.<br>
    And with one comprehensive curse<br>
    I close my brief narration,<br>
    And advertise it in my verse --<br>
    `For Sale! A Mountain Station.'
