<div class="verse">
  <p>
    A cloud of dust on the long, white road,<br>
    And the teams go creeping on<br>
    Inch by inch with the weary load;<br>
    And by the power of the green-hide goad<br>
    The distant goal is won.</p>

  <p>With eyes half-shut to the blinding dust,<br>
    And necks to the yokes bent low,<br>
    The beasts are pulling as bullocks must;<br>
    And the shining tires might also rust<br>
    While the spokes are turning slow.</p>

  <p>With face half-hid by a broad brimmed hat,<br>
    That shades from the heat's white waves,<br>
    And shouldered whip, with it's green hide plait,<br>
    The driver plods with a gait like that<br>
    Of his weary, patient slaves</p>

  <p>He wipes his brow, for the day in hot,<br>
    And spits to the left with spite;<br>
    He shouts at Bally, and flicks at Scot,<br>
    And raises dust from the back of Spot.<br>
    And spits to the dusty right.</p>

  <p>He'll sometimes pause as a thing of form<br>
    In front of a settlers door,<br>
    And ask for a drink, and remark "It's warm",<br>
    Or say "There's signs of a thunderstorm";<br>
    But he seldom utters more</p>

  <p>The rains are heavy on roads like these<br>
    And, fronting his lonely home,<br>
    For the days together the settler sees<br>
    The wagon bogged to the axeltrees,<br>
    Or ploughing the sodden loam.</p>

  <p>And then, when the roads are at their worst,<br>
    The bushman's children hear<br>
    The cruel blows of the whips reversed<br>
    While bullocks pull as their hearts would burst,<br>
    And bellow with pain and fear.</p>

  <p>And thus-with glimpses of home and rest-<br>
    Are the long, long journeys done;<br>
    And thus-'tis a thankless life at the best-<br>
    Is distance fought in the mighty West,<br>
    And the lonely battles won</p>
