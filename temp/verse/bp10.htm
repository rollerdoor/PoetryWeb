    The roving breezes come and go, the reed beds sweep and sway,<br>
    The sleepy river murmurs low, and loiters on its way,<br>
    It is the land of lots o' time along the Castlereagh.
  </p>

  <p>
    The old man's son had left the farm, he found it dull and slow,<br>
    He drifted to the great North-west where all the rovers go.<br>
    `He's gone so long,' the old man said, `he's dropped right out of mind,<br>
    But if you'd write a line to him I'd take it very kind;<br>
    He's shearing here and fencing there, a kind of waif and stray,<br>
    He's droving now with Conroy's sheep along the Castlereagh.
  </p>

  <p>
    `The sheep are travelling for the grass, and travelling very slow;<br>
    They may be at Mundooran now, or past the Overflow,<br>
    Or tramping down the black soil flats across by Waddiwong,<br>
    But all those little country towns would send the letter wrong,<br>
    The mailman, if he's extra tired, would pass them in his sleep,<br>
    It's safest to address the note to `Care of Conroy's sheep',<br>
    For five and twenty thousand head can scarcely go astray,<br>
    You write to `Care of Conroy's sheep along the Castlereagh'.'
  </p>

  <p>
    By rock and ridge and riverside the western mail has gone,<br>
    Across the great Blue Mountain Range to take that letter on.<br>
    A moment on the topmost grade while open fire doors glare,<br>
    She pauses like a living thing to breathe the mountain air,<br>
    Then launches down the other side across the plains away<br>
    To bear that note to `Conroy's sheep along the Castlereagh'.
  </p>

  <p>
    And now by coach and mailman's bag it goes from town to town,<br>
    And Conroy's Gap and Conroy's Creek have marked it `further down'.<br>
    Beneath a sky of deepest blue where never cloud abides,<br>
    A speck upon the waste of plain the lonely mailman rides.<br>
    Where fierce hot winds have set the pine and myall boughs asweep<br>
    He hails the shearers passing by for news of Conroy's sheep.<br>
    By big lagoons where wildfowl play and crested pigeons flock,<br>
    By camp fires where the drovers ride around their restless stock,<br>
    And past the teamster toiling down to fetch the wool away<br>
    My letter chases Conroy's sheep along the Castlereagh.
