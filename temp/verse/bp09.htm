  <p>
    You never heard tell of the story?<br>
    Well, now, I can hardly believe!<br>
    Never heard of the honour and glory<br>
    Of Pardon, the son of Reprieve?<br>
    But maybe you're only a Johnnie<br>
    And don't know a horse from a hoe?<br>
    Well, well, don't get angry, my sonny,<br>
    But, really, a young un should know.
  </p>

  <p>
    They bred him out back on the `Never',<br>
    His mother was Mameluke breed.<br>
    To the front -- and then stay there -- was ever<br>
    The root of the Mameluke creed.<br>
    He seemed to inherit their wiry<br>
    Strong frames -- and their pluck to receive --<br>
    As hard as a flint and as fiery<br>
    Was Pardon, the son of Reprieve.
  </p>

  <p>
    We ran him at many a meeting<br>
    At crossing and gully and town,<br>
    And nothing could give him a beating --<br>
    At least when our money was down.<br>
    For weight wouldn't stop him, nor distance,<br>
    Nor odds, though the others were fast,<br>
    He'd race with a dogged persistence,<br>
    And wear them all down at the last.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the Turon the Yattendon filly<br>
    Led by lengths at the mile-and-a-half,<br>
    And we all began to look silly,<br>
    While HER crowd were starting to laugh;<br>
    But the old horse came faster and faster,<br>
    His pluck told its tale, and his strength,<br>
    He gained on her, caught her, and passed her,<br>
    And won it, hands-down, by a length.
  </p>

  <p>
    And then we swooped down on Menindie<br>
    To run for the President's Cup --<br>
    Oh! that's a sweet township -- a shindy<br>
    To them is board, lodging, and sup.<br>
    Eye-openers they are, and their system<br>
    Is never to suffer defeat;<br>
    It's `win, tie, or wrangle' -- to best 'em<br>
    You must lose 'em, or else it's `dead heat'.
  </p>

  <p>
    We strolled down the township and found 'em<br>
    At drinking and gaming and play;<br>
    If sorrows they had, why they drowned 'em,<br>
    And betting was soon under way.<br>
    Their horses were good 'uns and fit 'uns,<br>
    There was plenty of cash in the town;<br>
    They backed their own horses like Britons,<br>
    And, Lord! how WE rattled it down!
  </p>

  <p>
    With gladness we thought of the morrow,<br>
    We counted our wagers with glee,<br>
    A simile homely to borrow --<br>
    `There was plenty of milk in our tea.'<br>
    You see we were green; and we never<br>
    Had even a thought of foul play,<br>
    Though we well might have known that the clever<br>
    Division would `put us away'.
  </p>

  <p>
    Experience `docet', they tell us,<br>
    At least so I've frequently heard,<br>
    But, `dosing' or `stuffing', those fellows<br>
    Were up to each move on the board:<br>
    They got to his stall -- it is sinful<br>
    To think what such villains would do --<br>
    And they gave him a regular skinful<br>
    Of barley -- green barley -- to chew.
  </p>

  <p>
    He munched it all night, and we found him<br>
    Next morning as full as a hog --<br>
    The girths wouldn't nearly meet round him;<br>
    He looked like an overfed frog.<br>
    We saw we were done like a dinner --<br>
    The odds were a thousand to one<br>
    Against Pardon turning up winner,<br>
    'Twas cruel to ask him to run.
  </p>

  <p>
    We got to the course with our troubles,<br>
    A crestfallen couple were we;<br>
    And we heard the `books' calling the doubles --<br>
    A roar like the surf of the sea;<br>
    And over the tumult and louder<br>
    Rang `Any price Pardon, I lay!'<br>
    Says Jimmy, `The children of Judah<br>
    Are out on the warpath to-day.'
  </p>

  <p>
    Three miles in three heats: -- Ah, my sonny,<br>
    The horses in those days were stout,<br>
    They had to run well to win money;<br>
    I don't see such horses about.<br>
    Your six-furlong vermin that scamper<br>
    Half-a-mile with their feather-weight up;<br>
    They wouldn't earn much of their damper<br>
    In a race like the President's Cup.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first heat was soon set a-going;<br>
    The Dancer went off to the front;<br>
    The Don on his quarters was showing,<br>
    With Pardon right out of the hunt.<br>
    He rolled and he weltered and wallowed --<br>
    You'd kick your hat faster, I'll bet;<br>
    They finished all bunched, and he followed<br>
    All lathered and dripping with sweat.
  </p>

  <p>
    But troubles came thicker upon us,<br>
    For while we were rubbing him dry<br>
    The stewards came over to warn us:<br>
    `We hear you are running a bye!<br>
    If Pardon don't spiel like tarnation<br>
    And win the next heat -- if he can --<br>
    He'll earn a disqualification;<br>
    Just think over THAT, now, my man!'
  </p>

  <p>
    Our money all gone and our credit,<br>
    Our horse couldn't gallop a yard;<br>
    And then people thought that WE did it!<br>
    It really was terribly hard.<br>
    We were objects of mirth and derision<br>
    To folk in the lawn and the stand,<br>
    And the yells of the clever division<br>
    Of `Any price Pardon!' were grand.
  </p>

  <p>
    We still had a chance for the money,<br>
    Two heats still remained to be run;<br>
    If both fell to us -- why, my sonny,<br>
    The clever division were done.<br>
    And Pardon was better, we reckoned,<br>
    His sickness was passing away,<br>
    So he went to the post for the second<br>
    And principal heat of the day.
  </p>

  <p>
    They're off and away with a rattle,<br>
    Like dogs from the leashes let slip,<br>
    And right at the back of the battle<br>
    He followed them under the whip.<br>
    They gained ten good lengths on him quickly<br>
    He dropped right away from the pack;<br>
    I tell you it made me feel sickly<br>
    To see the blue jacket fall back.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our very last hope had departed --<br>
    We thought the old fellow was done,<br>
    When all of a sudden he started<br>
    To go like a shot from a gun.<br>
    His chances seemed slight to embolden<br>
    Our hearts; but, with teeth firmly set,<br>
    We thought, `Now or never! The old 'un<br>
    May reckon with some of 'em yet.'
  </p>

  <p>
    Then loud rose the war-cry for Pardon;<br>
    He swept like the wind down the dip,<br>
    And over the rise by the garden,<br>
    The jockey was done with the whip<br>
    The field were at sixes and sevens --<br>
    The pace at the first had been fast --<br>
    And hope seemed to drop from the heavens,<br>
    For Pardon was coming at last.
  </p>

  <p>
    And how he did come! It was splendid;<br>
    He gained on them yards every bound,<br>
    Stretching out like a greyhound extended,<br>
    His girth laid right down on the ground.<br>
    A shimmer of silk in the cedars<br>
    As into the running they wheeled,<br>
    And out flashed the whips on the leaders,<br>
    For Pardon had collared the field.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then right through the ruck he came sailing --<br>
    I knew that the battle was won --<br>
    The son of Haphazard was failing,<br>
    The Yattendon filly was done;<br>
    He cut down the Don and the Dancer,<br>
    He raced clean away from the mare --<br>
    He's in front! Catch him now if you can, sir!<br>
    And up went my hat in the air!
  </p>

  <p>
    Then loud from the lawn and the garden<br>
    Rose offers of `Ten to one ON!'<br>
    `Who'll bet on the field? I back Pardon!'<br>
    No use; all the money was gone.<br>
    He came for the third heat light-hearted,<br>
    A-jumping and dancing about;<br>
    The others were done ere they started<br>
    Crestfallen, and tired, and worn out.
  </p>

  <p>
    He won it, and ran it much faster<br>
    Than even the first, I believe<br>
    Oh, he was the daddy, the master,<br>
    Was Pardon, the son of Reprieve.<br>
    He showed 'em the method to travel --<br>
    The boy sat as still as a stone --<br>
    They never could see him for gravel;<br>
    He came in hard-held, and alone.
  </p>

  <p>
    . . . . .
  </p>

  <p>
    But he's old -- and his eyes are grown hollow;<br>
    Like me, with my thatch of the snow;<br>
    When he dies, then I hope I may follow,<br>
    And go where the racehorses go.<br>
    I don't want no harping nor singing --<br>
    Such things with my style don't agree;<br>
    Where the hoofs of the horses are ringing<br>
    There's music sufficient for me.
  </p>

  <p>
    And surely the thoroughbred horses<br>
    Will rise up again and begin<br>
    Fresh races on far-away courses,<br>
    And p'raps they might let me slip in.<br>
    It would look rather well the race-card on<br>
    'Mongst Cherubs and Seraphs and things,<br>
    `Angel Harrison's black gelding Pardon,<br>
    Blue halo, white body and wings.'
  </p>

  <p>
    And if they have racing hereafter,<br>
    (And who is to say they will not?)<br>
    When the cheers and the shouting and laughter<br>
    Proclaim that the battle grows hot;<br>
    As they come down the racecourse a-steering,<br>
    He'll rush to the front, I believe;<br>
    And you'll hear the great multitude cheering<br>
    For Pardon, the son of Reprieve.
    <br>
