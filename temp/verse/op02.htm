  <p>
    I met Bill Brown on the Prospect Track<br>
    Astride of a camel cow;<br>
    An' I said, "I heard you had got the sack,<br>
    An' where are you makin' now?"
  </p>

  <p>
    "Well, mate," said William, "I thought it out,<br>
    An' I sez to myself, sez I:<br>
    There's not much hope for the rouseabout,<br>
    As the rousy can testify.
  </p>

  <p>
    "So I'll drink the honey of Freedom's Cup,<br>
    An' do as it pleases Brown;<br>
    I'll roll me swag when the sun gets up,<br>
    An' I'll camp when the sun goes down.
  </p>

  <p>
    "I'm makin' out where the diggers go,<br>
    Where the reefs run deep an' wide;<br>
    I'll wet my whistle at Tally-ho,<br>
    An' I'll yard me a Western bride.
  </p>

  <p>
    "She'll make me rugs with the skins I get<br>
    When I'm off o' the veins of gold;<br>
    She'll strip an' thatch when the days are wet,<br>
    An' she'll stoke when the nights are cold.
  </p>

  <p>
    "With only a fire in the trackless zone,<br>
    She'll cook like a chef, bet you;<br>
    Whatever she needs she will find alone<br>
    For her salmagundi too.
  </p>

  <p>
    "If the tracks are barren this moke I've got<br>
    Will do with a mulga-tree,<br>
    An' the hobble-chains an' the old quart-pot<br>
    Still jingle a tune to me."
  </p>

  <p>
    He filled his pipe ere he said, "So long!"<br>
    An' he rode where the sun grows red;<br>
    Where the bold are lured with a golden song<br>
    At times to a dead man's bed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Though many ask, 'tis a nut to crack,<br>
    Where old Bill Brown is now;<br>
    He was heard of last on the Prospect Track<br>
    Astride of a camel cow.
