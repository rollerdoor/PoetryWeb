  <p>
    When the caravans of wool-teams climbed the ranges from the West,<br>
    On a spur among the mountains stood `The Bullock-drivers' Rest';<br>
    It was built of bark and saplings, and was rather rough inside,<br>
    But 'twas good enough for bushmen in the careless days that died --<br>
    Just a quiet little shanty kept by `Something-in-Disguise',<br>
    As the bushmen called the landlord of the Shanty on the Rise.
  </p>

  <p>
    City swells who `do the Royal' would have called the Shanty low,<br>
    But 'twas better far and purer than some toney pubs I know;<br>
    For the patrons of the Shanty had the principles of men,<br>
    And the spieler, if he struck it, wasn't welcome there again.<br>
    You could smoke and drink in quiet, yarn, or else soliloquise,<br>
    With a decent lot of fellows in the Shanty on the Rise.
  </p>

  <p>
    'Twas the bullock-driver's haven when his team was on the road,<br>
    And the waggon-wheels were groaning as they ploughed beneath the load;<br>
    And I mind how weary teamsters struggled on while it was light,<br>
    Just to camp within a cooey of the Shanty for the night;<br>
    And I think the very bullocks raised their heads and fixed their eyes<br>
    On the candle in the window of the Shanty on the Rise.
  </p>

  <p>
    And the bullock-bells were clanking from the marshes on the flats<br>
    As we hurried to the Shanty, where we hung our dripping hats;<br>
    And we took a drop of something that was brought at our desire,<br>
    As we stood with steaming moleskins in the kitchen by the fire.<br>
    Oh! it roared upon a fireplace of the good, old-fashioned size,<br>
    When the rain came down the chimney of the Shanty on the Rise.
  </p>

  <p>
    They got up a Christmas party in the Shanty long ago,<br>
    While I camped with Jimmy Nowlett on the riverbank below;<br>
    Poor old Jim was in his glory -- they'd elected him M.C.,<br>
    For there wasn't such another raving lunatic as he.<br>
    `Mr. Nowlett, Mr. Swaller!' shouted Something-in-Disguise,<br>
    As we walked into the parlour of the Shanty on the Rise.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is little real pleasure in the city where I am --<br>
    There's a swarry round the corner with its mockery and sham;<br>
    But a fellow can be happy when around the room he whirls<br>
    In a party up the country with the jolly country girls.<br>
    Why, at times I almost fancied I was dancing on the skies,<br>
    When I danced with Mary Carey in the Shanty on the Rise.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jimmy came to me and whispered, and I muttered, `Go along!'<br>
    But he shouted, `Mr. Swaller will oblige us with a song!'<br>
    And at first I said I wouldn't, and I shammed a little too,<br>
    Till the girls began to whisper, `Mr. Swallow, now, ah, DO!'<br>
    So I sang a song of something 'bout the love that never dies,<br>
    And the chorus shook the rafters of the Shanty on the Rise.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jimmy burst his concertina, and the bullock-drivers went<br>
    For the corpse of Joe the Fiddler, who was sleeping in his tent;<br>
    Joe was tired and had lumbago, and he wouldn't come, he said,<br>
    But the case was very urgent, so they pulled him out of bed;<br>
    And they fetched him, for the bushmen knew that Something-in-Disguise<br>
    Had a cure for Joe's lumbago in the Shanty on the Rise.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jim and I were rather quiet while escorting Mary home,<br>
    'Neath the stars that hung in clusters, near and distant, from the dome;<br>
    And we walked so very silent -- being lost in reverie --<br>
    That we heard the settlers'-matches rustle softly on the tree;<br>
    And I wondered who would win her when she said her sweet good-byes --<br>
    But she died at one-and-twenty, and was buried on the Rise.
  </p>

  <p>
    I suppose the Shanty vanished from the ranges long ago,<br>
    And the girls are mostly married to the chaps I used to know;<br>
    My old chums are in the distance -- some have crossed the border-line,<br>
    But in fancy still their glasses chink against the rim of mine.<br>
    And, upon the very centre of the greenest spot that lies<br>
    In my fondest recollection, stands the Shanty on the Rise.<br>
