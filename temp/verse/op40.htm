    Old Jacky gazed on the setting sun<br>
    As he stood by his garden gate,<br>
    When to him appeared a 'regular'one<br>
    Of the sect called the Swag Estate.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Chance of a job?' 'Twas the fixed address,<br>
    And it glibly slipped his jaws,<br>
    As a parson's patter is void of stress,<br>
    And told, too, for the self-same cause.
  </p>

  <p>
    An idea lit up the humorist's brow<br>
    Of a fine retributive plan<br>
    And he answered, 'Well, I want just now<br>
    A really active man.
  </p>

  <p>
    'Can you run? Would you mind running round the shed?<br>
    You can mess with the men tonight.'<br>
    The thought of a feed of yeasty bread<br>
    Made the whaler's heart as light.
  </p>

  <p>
    He dropped his 'hump' and he hitched his trews<br>
    And took up a hole in his belt;<br>
    A stomach ill-used braced up his thews,<br>
    His soul two square feeds smelt.
  </p>

  <p>
    At something like a 'Botany" pace<br>
    He covered the track set out,<br>
    Great tears of sweat ran down his face '<br>
    He was winded, just about.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the woolly joker again he faced,<br>
    plying a dirty 'wipe',<br>
    A smile that gentleman's visage graced<br>
    Suspiciously rich and ripe.
  </p>

  <p>
    'Ah! very good. Yes, I think you'll do<br>
    (Give this to the cook) very well.<br>
    In the morning, h'm, I want you to<br>
    H'm, clear out of here like ' blazes!'
  </p>
