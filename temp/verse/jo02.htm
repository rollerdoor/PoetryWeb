  <p>
    Oh, stick me in the old caboose this
    night of wind and rain,<br>
    And let the doves of fancy loose to bill and coo again.<br>
    I want to feel the pulse of love that warmed the blood like wine;<br>
    I want to see the smile above this kind old land of mine.
  </p>

  <p>
    So come you by your parted ways that wind the wide world through,<br>
    And make a ring around the blaze the way we used to do;<br>
    The "fountain" on the sooted crane will sing the old, old song<br>
    Of common joys in homely vein forgotten, ah, too long.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="ital">
      The years have turned the rusted key, and time is on the jog,<br>
      Yet spend another night with me around the boree log.
    </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    Now someone driving through the rain will happen in, I bet;<br>
    So fill the fountain up again, and leave the table set.<br>
    For this was ours with pride to say-and all the world defy-<br>
    No stranger ever turned away, no neighbour passed us by.
  </p>

  <p>
    Bedad, he'll have to stay the night; the rain is going to pour-<br>
    So make the rattling windows tight, and close the kitchen door,<br>
    And bring the old lopsided chair, the tattered cushion, too-<br>
    We'll make the stranger happy there, the way we used to do.
  </p>

    He'll fill his pipe, and good and well, and all aglow within<br>
    We'll hear the news he has to tell, the yarns he has to spin;<br>
    Yarns-yes, and super-yarns, forsooth, to set the eyes agog,<br>
    And freeze the blood of trusting youth around the boree log.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then stir it up and make it burn; the poker's next to you:<br>
    Come, let us poke it all in turn, the way we used to do.<br>
    There's many a memory bright and fair will tingle at a name-<br>
    But leave unstirred the embers there we cannot fan to flame,
  </p>
