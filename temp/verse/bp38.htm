  <p>
    We buried old Bob where the bloodwoods wave<br>
    At the foot of the Eaglehawk;<br>
    We fashioned a cross on the old man's grave,<br>
    For fear that his ghost might walk;<br>
    We carved his name on a bloodwood tree,<br>
    With the date of his sad decease,<br>
    And in place of `Died from effects of spree',<br>
    We wrote `May he rest in peace'.
  </p>

  <p>
    For Bob was known on the Overland,<br>
    A regular old bush wag,<br>
    Tramping along in the dust and sand,<br>
    Humping his well-worn swag.<br>
    He would camp for days in the river-bed,<br>
    And loiter and `fish for whales'.<br>
    `I'm into the swagman's yard,' he said,<br>
    `And I never shall find the rails.'
  </p>

  <p>
    But he found the rails on that summer night<br>
    For a better place -- or worse,<br>
    As we watched by turns in the flickering light<br>
    With an old black gin for nurse.<br>
    The breeze came in with the scent of pine,<br>
    The river sounded clear,<br>
    When a change came on, and we saw the sign<br>
    That told us the end was near.
  </p>

  <p>
    But he spoke in a cultured voice and low --<br>
    `I fancy they've "sent the route";<br>
    I once was an army man, you know,<br>
    Though now I'm a drunken brute;<br>
    But bury me out where the bloodwoods wave,<br>
    And if ever you're fairly stuck,<br>
    Just take and shovel me out of the grave<br>
    And, maybe, I'll bring you luck..
  </p>

  <p>
    `For I've always heard --' here his voice fell weak,<br>
    His strength was well-nigh sped,<br>
    He gasped and struggled and tried to speak,<br>
    Then fell in a moment -- dead.<br>
    Thus ended a wasted life and hard,<br>
    Of energies misapplied --<br>
    Old Bob was out of the `swagman's yard'<br>
    And over the Great Divide.
  </p>

  <p>*****</p>

  <p>
    The drought came down on the field and flock,<br>
    And never a raindrop fell,<br>
    Though the tortured moans of the starving stock<br>
    Might soften a fiend from hell.<br>
    And we thought of the hint that the swagman gave<br>
    When he went to the Great Unseen --<br>
    We shovelled the skeleton out of the grave<br>
    To see what his hint might mean.
  </p>

  <p>
    We dug where the cross and the grave posts were,<br>
    We shovelled away the mould,<br>
    When sudden a vein of quartz lay bare<br>
    All gleaming with yellow gold.<br>
    'Twas a reef with never a fault nor baulk<br>
    That ran from the range's crest,<br>
    And the richest mine on the Eaglehawk<br>
    Is known as `The Swagman's Rest'.
