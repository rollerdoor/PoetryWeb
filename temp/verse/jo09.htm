<div class="verse">
  <p>
    The bishop sat in lordly state and purple cap sublime,<br>
    And galvanized the old bush church at Confirmation time;<br>
    And all the kids were mustered up from fifty miles around,<br>
    With Sunday clothes, and staring eyes, and ignorance profound.<br>
    Now was it fate, or was it grace, whereby they yarded too<br>
    An overgrown two-storey lad from Tangmalangaloo?
  </p>

  <p>
    A hefty son of virgin soil, where nature has had her fling,<br>
    And grows the trefoil three feet high and mats it in the spring;<br>
    Where mighty hills uplift their heads to pierce the welkin's rim,<br>
    And trees sprout up a hundred feet before they shoot a limb;<br>
    There everything is big and grand, and men are giants too -<br>
    But Christian Knowledge wilts, alas, at Tangmalangaloo.
  </p>

  <p>
    The bishop summed the youngsters up, as bishops only can;<br>
    He cast a searching glance around, then fixed upon his man.<br>
    But glum and dumb and undismayed through every bout he sat;<br>
    He seemed to think that he was there, but wasn't sure of that.<br>
    The bishop gave a scornful look, as bishops sometimes do,<br>
    And glared right through the pagan in from Tangmalangaloo.
  </p>

  <p>
    'Come, tell me, boy,' his lordship said, in crushing tones severe,<br>
    'Come, tell me why is Christmas Day the greatest of the year?<br>
    'How is it that around the world we celebrate that day<br>
    'And send a name upon a card to those who're far away?<br>
    'Why is it wandering ones return with smiles and greetings, too?<br>
    A squall of knowledge hit the lad from Tangmalangaloo.
  </p>

  <p>
    He gave a lurch which set a-shake the vases on the shelf,<br>
    He knocked the benches all askew, up-ending of himself.<br>
    And oh, how pleased his lordship was, and how he smiled to say,<br>
    'That's good, my boy. Come, tell me now; and what is Christmas Day?<br>
    The ready answer bared a fact no bishop ever knew -<br>
    'It's the day before the races out at Tangmalangaloo.
