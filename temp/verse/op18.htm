<div class="verse">
  <p>
    We severed in Autumn early,<br>
    Ere the earth was torn by the plough;<br>
    The wheat and the oats and the barley<br>
    Are ripe for the harvest now.<br>
    We sunder'd one misty morning<br>
    Ere the hills were dimm'd by the rain;<br>
    Through the flowers those hills adorning —<br>
    Thou comest not back again.
  </p>

  <p>
    My heart is heavy and weary<br>
    With the weight of a weary soul;<br>
    The mid-day glare grows dreary,<br>
    And dreary the midnight scroll.<br>
    The corn-stalks sigh for the sickle,<br>
    'Neath the load of their golden grain;<br>
    I sigh for a mate more fickle —<br>
    Thou comest not back again.
  </p>

  <p>
    The warm sun riseth and setteth,<br>
    The night bringeth moistening dew,<br>
    But the soul that longeth forgetteth<br>
    The warmth and the moisture too.<br>
    In the hot sun rising and setting<br>
    There is naught save feverish pain;<br>
    There are tears in the night-dews wetting —<br>
    Thou comest not back again.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thy voice in my ear still mingles<br>
    With the voices of whisp'ring trees,<br>
    Thy kiss on my cheek still tingles<br>
    At each kiss of the summer breeze.<br>
    While dreams of the past are thronging<br>
    For substance of shades in vain,<br>
    I am waiting, watching and longing —<br>
    Thou comest not back again.
  </p>

  <p>
    Waiting and watching ever,<br>
    Longing and lingering yet;<br>
    Leaves rustle and corn-stalks quiver,<br>
    Winds murmur and waters fret.<br>
    No answer they bring, no greeting,<br>
    No speech, save that sad refrain,<br>
    Nor voice, save an echo repeating —<br>
    He cometh not back again.
  </p>
