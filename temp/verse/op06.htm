<div class="verse">
  <p>
    The love of field and coppice,<br>
    Of green and shaded lanes,<br>
    Of ordered woods and gardens<br>
    Is running in your veins;<br>
    Strong love of grey-blue distance<br>
    Brown streams and soft dim skies -<br>
    I know but cannot share it,<br>
    My love is otherwise.
  </p>

  <p>
    I love a sunburnt country,<br>
    A land of sweeping plains,<br>
    Of ragged mountain ranges,<br>
    Of droughts and flooding rains.<br>
    I love her far horizons,<br>
    I love her jewel-sea,<br>
    Her beauty and her terror-<br>
    This wide brown land for me.
  </p>

  <p>
    The stark white ring-barked forests,<br>
    All tragic to the moon,<br>
    The saphirre misted mountains,<br>
    The hot gold hush of noon,<br>
    Green tangle of the brushes<br>
    Where lithe lianas coil,<br>
    And orchids deck the tree-tops,<br>
    And ferns the warm dark soil.
  </p>

  <p>
    Core of my heart, my country!<br>
    Her pitiless blue sky,<br>
    When sick at heart around us<br>
    We watch the cattle die -<br>
    But then the grey clouds gather,<br>
    And we can bless again<br>
    The drumming of an army,<br>
    The steady soaking rain.
  </p>

  <p>
    Core of my heart, my country!<br>
    Land of the rainbow gold,<br>
    For flood and fire and famine<br>
    She pays us back threefold.<br>
    Over the thirsty paddocks<br>
    Watch, after many days,<br>
    The filmy veil of greenness<br>
    That thickens as we gaze
  </p>

  <p>
    An opal hearted country,<br>
    A wilful, lavish land-<br>
    All you who have not loved her,<br>
    You will not understand -<br>
    Though earth holds many splendours,<br>
    Wherever I may die,<br>
    I know to what brown country<br>
    My homing thoughts will fly.
