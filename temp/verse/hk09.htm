<div class="verse">
  <p>
    Where the pines with the eagles are nestled in rifts,<br>
    And the torrent leaps down to the surges,<br>
    I have followed her, clambering over the clifts,<br>
    By the chasms and moon-haunted verges.<br>
    I know she is fair as the angels are fair,<br>
    For have I not caught a faint glimpse of her there;<br>
    A glimpse of her face and her glittering hair,<br>
    And a hand with the Harp of Australia?
  </p>

  <p>
    I never can reach you, to hear the sweet voice<br>
    So full with the music of fountains!<br>
    Oh! when will you meet with that soul of your choice,<br>
    Who will lead you down here from the mountains?<br>
    A lyre-bird lit on a shimmering space;<br>
    It dazzled mine eyes and I turned from the place,<br>
    And wept in the dark for a glorious face,<br>
    And a hand with the Harp of Australia!
