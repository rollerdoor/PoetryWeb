    Now this is the law of the Overland that all in the West obey -<br>
    A man must cover with travelling sheep a six-mile stage a day;<br>
    But this is the law which the drovers make, right easily understood,<br>
    They travel their stage where the grass is bad, but they camp where the grass is good;<br>
    They camp, and they ravage the squatter's grass till never a blade remains,<br>
    Then they drift away as the white clouds drift on the edge of the saltbush plains;<br>
    From camp to camp and from run to run they battle it hand to hand<br>
    For a blade of grass and the right to pass on the track of the Overland.
  </p>

  <p>
    For this is the law of the Great Stock Routes, 'tis written in white and black -<br>
    The man that goes with a travelling mob must keep to a half-mile track;<br>
    And the drovers keep to a half-mile track on the runs where the grass is dead,<br>
    But they spread their sheep on a well-grassed run till they go with a two-mile spread.<br>
    So the squatters hurry the drovers on from dawn till the fall of night,<br>
    And the squatters' dogs and the drovers' dogs get mixed in a deadly fight;<br>
    Yet the squatters' men, though they hunt the mob, are willing the peace to keep,<br>
    For the drovers learn how to use their hands when they go with the travelling sheep.
  </p>

  <p>
    But this is the tale of a jackeroo that came from a foreign strand,<br>
    And the fight that he fought with Saltbush Bill, the King of the Overland.<br>
    Now Saltbush Bill was a drover tough, as ever the country knew,<br>
    He had fought his way on the Great Stock Routes from the sea to the big Barcoo;<br>
    He could tell when he came to a friendly run that gave him a chance to spread,<br>
    And he knew where the hungry owners were that hurried his sheep ahead;<br>
    He was drifting down in the 'Eighty drought with a mob that could scarcely creep -<br>
    When kangaroos by the thousands starve, it is rough on the travelling sheep.
  </p>

  <p>
    And he camped one night at the crossing-place on the edge of the Wilga run,<br>
    "We must manage a feed for them here," he said, "or half of the mob are done!"<br>
    So he spread them out when they left the camp wherever they liked to go,<br>
    Till he grew aware of a jackeroo with a station-hand in tow,<br>
    And they set to work on the straggling sheep, and with many a stockwhip crack<br>
    They forced them in where the grass was dead in the space of the half mile track;<br>
    And William prayed that the hand of Fate might suddenly strike him blue<br>
    But he'd get some grass for his starving sheep in the teeth of that jackeroo.
  </p>

  <p>
    So he turned and cursed the jackeroo, he cursed him alive or dead,<br>
    From the soles of his great unwieldy feet to the crown of his ugly head,<br>
    With an extra curse on the moke he rode and the cur at his heels that ran,<br>
    Till the jackeroo from his horse got down and went for the droving man;<br>
    With the station-hand for his picker-up, though the sheep ran loose the while,<br>
    They battled it out on the saltbush plain in the regular prize-ring style.<br>
    Now the new-chum fought for his honour's sake and the pride of the English race,<br>
    But the drover fought for his daily bread with a smile on his bearded face -
  </p>

  <p>
    So he shifted ground and he sparred for wind and he made it a lengthy mill,<br>
    And from time to time as his scouts came in they whispered to Saltbush Bill -<br>
    "We have spread the sheep with a two-mile spread, and the grass it is something grand,<br>
    You must stick to him, Bill, for another round for the pride of the Overland."<br>
    The new-chum made it a rushing fight, though never a blow got home,<br>
    Till the sun rode high in the cloudless sky and glared on the brick-red loam,<br>
    Till the sheep drew in to the shelter-trees and settled them down to rest;<br>
    Then the drover said he would fight no more and gave his opponent best.
  </p>

  <p>
    So the new-chum rode to the station straight, and he told them a story grand<br>
    Of the desperate fight that he fought that day with the King of the Overland.<br>
    And the tale went home to the Public Schools of the pluck of the English swell,<br>
    How the drover fought for his very life, but blood in the end must tell.<br>
    But the travelling sheep and the Wilga sheep were boxed on the Old Man Plain.<br>
    'Twas a full week's work ere they drafted out and hunted them off again;<br>
    With a week's good grass in their wretched hides, with a curse and a stockwhip crack,<br>
    They hunted them off on the road once more to starve on the half-mile track.
  </p>

  <p>
    And Saltbush Bill, on the Overland, will many a time recite<br>
    How the best day's work that he ever did was the day that he lost the fight.
