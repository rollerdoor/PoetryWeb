    The Morning Star paled slowly, the Cross hung low to the sea,<br>
    And down the shadowy reaches the tide came swirling free,<br>
    The lustrous purple blackness of the soft Australian night,<br>
    Waned in the gray awakening that heralded the light;<br>
    Still in the dying darkness, still in the forest dim<br>
    The pearly dew of the dawning clung to each giant limb,<br>
    Till the sun came up from ocean, red with the cold sea mist,<br>
    And smote on the limestone ridges, and the shining tree-tops kissed;<br>
    Then the fiery Scorpion vanished, the magpie's note was heard,<br>
    And the wind in the she-oak wavered, and the honeysuckles stirred,<br>
    The airy golden vapour rose from the river breast,<br>
    The kingfisher came darting out of his crannied nest,<br>
    And the bulrushes and reed-beds put off their sallow gray<br>
    And burnt with cloudy crimson at dawning of the day.</font>
