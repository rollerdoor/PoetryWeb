    When I sit and watch the cricket, there's a place I often go<br>
    Through a window, where I stare upon a yard that needs a mow<br>
    There I am - the youngster with the grin from ear to ear<br>
    Although those days have left me now, the memories are clear<br>
    Of a willow hurled in spirals to the call of "Hills or Flats"<br>
    By a kid who knows for certain - if he wins the toss, he bats
  </p>

  <p>
    On a track where something well pitched up could whistle past your scone<br>
    Where no man got out 'leg before' though 'nick behind' was gone<br>
    'One hand off the house' was fair, the road was 'six and out'<br>
    And that six was often worth it if the fruit was there to clout<br>
    "Hit the car - you're gone my friend - the shed is that way son!"<br>
    In the name of backyard cricket, geez we had some bloody fun
  </p>

  <p>
    The rubbish bin was put in place and everything was apples<br>
    Your neighbours were the Poms of course, and you, the mighty "Chappells"<br>
    To be bowled by one's own brother was the ultimate in shame<br>
    And until you knocked his melon off, you hadn't cleared your name<br>
    Then, sometimes when you took the crease, you'd face like Allan Border<br>
    If you were naturally right handed, there were problems made to order.
  </p>

  <p>
    Still, you'd raise your bat to barking dogs when runs were flowing freely<br>
    While the keeper chewed your ear off like his idols, Marsh and Healy<br>
    To bowl and stare like Thommo often had the batsman itchy<br>
    As you 'walked the walk' like David Boon and 'talked the talk' like Richie<br>
    You'd shout HOWZAT like DK did and chew the gum like Viv<br>
    For the sake of dreams, there was nothing that a player wouldn't give.
  </p>

  <p>
    In a land of backyard cricketers - it's always been the way<br>
    From the boyhood dreams of Bradman to the yards of kids today<br>
    Where, once, they played like Morris, Brown and Miller for their scores<br>
    Today they star as Glen McGrath, as Warney, or the Waughs
  </p>

  <p>
    Remember all those years ago in days of make believe<br>
    When your country's hopes depended on the magic you could weave?<br>
    A record score was needed and the odds they said were 'zero'<br>
    But they didn't know the script was being written by the hero<br>
    As the winning runs were belted down behind the barbecue
  </p>

  <p>
    You wondered in your wildest dreams if fairytales came true<br>
    But that's the land we live in and the people that we've been<br>
    And the glitter at the rainbow's end well, that's the baggy green<br>
    And just ask Adam Gilchrist if that dream was worth his while<br>
    Just ask Justin Langer - and I bet you'll get a smile.<br>
    It's a smile that spells the future for this cricket-loving nation<br>
    And gazing out my window, now it gives me inspiration<br>
    Yes, I think I'll tape the old ball up and mow myself a wicket<br>
    Then I'll ring the boys - "The square's prepared - <br>
    let's play ourselves some cricket!
  </p>
