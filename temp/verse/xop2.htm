  <p>
    The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees,<br>
    The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,<br>
    The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,<br>
    And the highwayman came riding — riding — riding,<br>
    The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door.
  </p>

  <p>
    He'd a French cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin,<br>
    A coat of claret velvet, and breeches of brown doeskin,<br>
    They fitted with never a wrinkle; his boots were up to the thigh;<br>
    And he rode with a jewelled twinkle,<br>
    His pistol butts a-twinkle,<br>
    His rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn-yard;<br>
    And he tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred;<br>
    He whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there,<br>
    But the landlord's black-eyed daughter,<br>
    Bess, the landlord's daughter,<br>
    Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.
  </p>

  <p>
    And dark in the dark old inn-yard a stable wicket creaked,<br>
    Where Tim the ostler listened; his face was white and peaked;<br>
    His eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay,<br>
    But he loved the landlord's daughter,<br>
    The landlord's red-lipped daughter —<br>
    Dumb as a dog he listened, and he heard the robber say —
  </p>

  <p>
    "One kiss, my bonnie sweetheart, I'm after a prize to-night,<br>
    But I shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light;<br>
    Yet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day,<br>
    Then look for me by moonlight,<br>
    Watch for me by moonlight,<br>
    I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way."
  </p>

  <p>
    He rose upright in the stirrups; he scarce could reach her hand,<br>
    But she loosened her hair i' the casement! His face burnt like a brand<br>
    As the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast;<br>
    And he kissed the waves in the moonlight<br>
    (Oh, sweet black waves in the moon-light);<br>
    Then he tugged at his rein in the moonlight, and galloped away to the west.
  </p>

  <p>
    He did not come in the dawning; he did not come at noon;<br>
    And out o' the tawny sunset, before the rise o' the moon,<br>
    When the road was a gipsy's ribbon, looping the purple moor,<br>
    A red-coat troop came marching — marching — marching,<br>
    King George's men came marching, up to the old inn-door.
  </p>

  <p>
    They said no word to the landlord, they drank his ale instead,<br>
    But they gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of her narrow bed;<br>
    Two of them knelt at her casement, with muskets at their side!<br>
    There was death at every window;<br>
    And hell at one dark window;<br>
    For Bess could see, through her casement, the road that he would ride.
  </p>

  <p>
    They had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering jest;<br>
    They had bound a musket beside her, with the barrel beneath her breast!<br>
    "Now keep good watch!" and they kissed her. She heard the dead man say —<br>
    <span class="ital">Look for me by moonlight;<br>
      Watch for me by moonlight;<br>
      I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way!</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    She twisted her hands behind her; but all the knots held good!<br>
    She writhed her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat, or blood,<br>
    They stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like years,<br>
    Till, now, on the stroke of midnight,<br>
    Cold, on the stroke of midnight,<br>
    The tip of one finger touched it! The trigger at least was hers!
  </p>

  <p>
    The tip of one finger touched it; she strove no more for the rest!<br>
    Up, she stood up to attention, with the barrel beneath her breast,<br>
    She would not risk their hearing; she would not strive again;<br>
    For the road lay bare in the moonlight;<br>
    Blank and bare in the moonlight;<br>
    And the blood of her veins in the moonlight throbbed to her love's refrain.
  </p>

  <p><span class="ital">Tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot! </span>Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear;<br>
    <span class="ital">Tlot-tlot, tlot-tlot, </span>in the distance! Were they deaf that they did not hear?<br>
    Down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill,<br>
    The highwayman came riding, riding, riding!<br>
    The red-coats looked to their priming! she stood up, straight and still!
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="ital">Tlot-tlot, </span>in the frosty silence! <span class="ital">Tlot-tlot, </span>in the echoing
    night!<br>
    Nearer he came and nearer! Her face was like a light!<br>
    Her eyes grew wide for a moment; she drew one last deep breath,<br>
    Then her finger moved in the moonlight,<br>
    Her musket shattered the moonlight,<br>
    Shattered her breast in the moonlight, and warned him — with her death.
  </p>

  <p>
    He turned; he spurred to the Westward; he did not know who stood<br>
    Bowed, with her head o'er the musket, drenched with her own red blood!<br>
    Not till the dawn he heard it, and slowly blanched to hear<br>
    How Bess, the landlord's daughter,<br>
    The landlord's black-eyed daughter,<br>
    Had watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there.
  </p>

  <p>
    Back, he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky,<br>
    With the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high!<br>
    Blood-red were his spurs i' the golden moon; Wine-red was his velvet coat;<br>
    When they shot him down on the highway,<br>
    Down like a dog on the highway:<br>
    And he lay in his blood on the highway, with the bunch of lace at his throat.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="ital">And still of a winter's night, they say, when the wind is in the trees,<br>
      When the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,<br>
      When the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,<br>
      A highwayman comes riding — riding — riding,<br>
      A highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn-door.</span>
