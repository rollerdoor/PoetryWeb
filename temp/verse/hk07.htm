  <p>
    A splendid sun betwixt the trees<br>
    Long spikes of flame did shoot,<br>
    When turning to the fragrant South,<br>
    With longing eyes and burning mouth,<br>
    I stretched a hand athwart the drouth,<br>
    And plucked at cooling fruit.
  </p>

  <p>
    So thirst was quenched, and hastening on<br>
    With strength returned to me,<br>
    I set my face against the noon,<br>
    And reached a denser forest soon;<br>
    Which dipped into a still lagoon<br>
    Hard by the sooming sea.
  </p>

  <p>
    All day the ocean beat on bar<br>
    And bank of gleaming sand;<br>
    Yet that lone pool was always mild,<br>
    It never moved when waves were wild,<br>
    But slumbered, like a quiet child,<br>
    Upon the lap of land.
  </p>

  <p>
    And when I rested on the brink,<br>
    Amongst the fallen flowers,<br>
    I lay in calm; no leaves were stirred<br>
    By breath of wind, or wing of bird;<br>
    It was so still, you might have heard<br>
    The footfalls of the hours.
  </p>

  <p>
    Faint slumbrous scents of roses filled<br>
    The air which covered me:<br>
    My words were low — "she loved them so,<br>
    In Eden vales such odours blow:<br>
    How strange it is that roses grow<br>
    So near the shores of Sea!"
  </p>

  <p>
    A sweeter fragrance never came<br>
    Across the Fields of Yore!<br>
    And when I said — "we here would dwell," —<br>
    A low voice on the silence fell —<br>
    "Ah! if you loved the roses well,<br>
    You loved Aileen the more."
  </p>

  <p>"Ay, that I did, and now would turn,<br>
    And fall and worship her!<br>
    But Oh, you dwell so far — so high!<br>
    One cannot reach, though he may try,<br>
    The Morning land, and Jasper sky —<br>
    The balmy hills of Myrrh.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Why vex me with delicious hints<br>
    Of fairest face, and rarest blooms;<br>
    You Spirit of a darling Dream<br>
    Which links itself with every theme<br>
    And thought of mine by surf or stream,<br>
    In glens — or caverned glooms?"
  </p>

  <p>
    She said, "thy wishes led me down,<br>
    From amaranthine bowers:<br>
    And since my face was haunting thee<br>
    With roses (dear which used to be),<br>
    They all have hither followed me,<br>
    The scents and shapes of flowers."
  </p>

  <p>
    "Then stay, mine own evangel, stay!<br>
    Or, going, take me too;<br>
    But let me sojourn by your side,<br>
    If here we dwell or there abide,<br>
    It matters not!" I madly cried —<br>
    "I only care for you."
  </p>

  <p>
    Oh, glittering Form that would not stay! —<br>
    Oh, sudden, sighing breeze!<br>
    A fainting rainbow dropped below<br>
    Far gleaming peaks and walls of snow<br>
    And there, a weary way, I go,<br>
    Towards the Sunrise seas.
