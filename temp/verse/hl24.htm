<div class="verse">
  <p>
    His old clay pipe stuck in his mouth,<br>
    His hat pushed from his brow,<br>
    His dress best fitted for the South —<br>
    I think I see him now;<br>
    And when the city streets are still,<br>
    And sleep upon me comes,<br>
    I often dream that me an' Bill<br>
    Are humpin' of our drums.
  </p>

  <p>
    I mind the time when first I came<br>
    A stranger to the land;<br>
    And I was stumped, an' sick, an' lame<br>
    When Bill took me in hand.<br>
    Old Bill was what a chap would call<br>
    A friend in poverty,<br>
    And he was very kind to all,<br>
    And very good to me.
  </p>

  <p>
    We'd camp beneath the lonely trees<br>
    And sit beside the blaze,<br>
    A-nursin' of our wearied knees,<br>
    A-smokin' of our clays.<br>
    Or when we'd journeyed damp an' far,<br>
    An' clouds were in the skies,<br>
    We'd camp in some old shanty bar,<br>
    And sit a-tellin' lies.
  </p>

  <p>
    Though time had writ upon his brow<br>
    And rubbed away his curls,<br>
    He always was — an' may be now —<br>
    A favourite with the girls;<br>
    I've heard bush-wimmin scream an' squall —<br>
    I've see'd 'em laugh until<br>
    They could not do their work at all,<br>
    Because of Corny Bill.
  </p>

  <p>
    He was the jolliest old pup<br>
    As ever you did see,<br>
    And often at some bush kick-up<br>
    They'd make old Bill M.C.<br>
    He'd make them dance and sing all night,<br>
    He'd make the music hum,<br>
    But he'd be gone at mornin' light<br>
    A-humpin' of his drum.
  </p>

  <p>
    Though joys of which the poet rhymes<br>
    Was not for Bill an' me,<br>
    I think we had some good old times<br>
    Out on the wallaby.<br>
    I took a wife and left off rum,<br>
    An' camped beneath a roof;<br>
    But Bill preferred to hump his drum<br>
    A-paddin' of the hoof.
  </p>

  <p>The lazy, idle loafers what<br>
    In toney houses camp<br>
    Would call old Bill a drunken sot,<br>
    A loafer, or a tramp;<br>
    But if the dead should ever dance —<br>
    As poets say they will —<br>
    I think I'd rather take my chance<br>
    Along of Corny Bill.
  </p>

  <p>
    His long life's-day is nearly o'er,<br>
    Its shades begin to fall;<br>
    He soon must mount his bluey for<br>
    The last long tramp of all;<br>
    I trust that when, in bush an' town,<br>
    He's lived and learnt his fill,<br>
    They'll let the golden slip-rails down<br>
    For poor old Corny Bill.
