    There's a little worn-out pony this side of Hogan's shack <br>
    With a snip upon his nuzzle and a mark upon his back;<br>
    Just a common little pony is what most people say,<br>
    But then of course they've never heard what happened in his day:<br>
    I was droving on the Leichhardt with a mob of pikers wild,<br>
    When this tibby little pony belonged to Hogan's child.
  </p>

  <p>
    One night it started raining — we were camping on a rise,<br>
    When the wind blew cold and bleakly and thunder shook the skies;<br>
    The lightning cut the figure eight around the startled cattle, <br>
    Then down there fell torrential rains and then began a battle.<br>
    In a fraction of an instant the wild mob became insane, <br>
    Careering through the timber helter-skelter for the plain.
  </p>

  <p>
    The timber fell before them like grass before a scythe,<br>
    And heavy rain in torrents poured from the grimly blackened sky; <br>
    The mob rushed ever onward through the slippery sodden ground, <br>
    While the men and I worked frantically to veer their heads around; <br>
    And then arose an awful cry — it came from Jimmy Rild,<br>
    For there between two saplings straight ahead was Hogan's child.
  </p>

  <p>
    I owned not man or devil, I had not prayed since when,<br>
    But I called upon the blessed Lord to show His mercy then;<br>
    I shut my eyes and ground my teeth, the end I dared not see<br>
    Great God! The cattle — a thousand head — were crashing through the trees.<br>
    "God pity us bush children in our darkest hour of need,"<br>
    Were the words I prayed although I followed neither church or creed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then my right-hand 'man was shouting, the faithful Jimmy Rild, <br>
    "Did you see it, Harry, see the way he saved that child?"<br>
    "Saved! Saved, did you say?" and I shot upright with a bound, <br>
    "Yes, saved," he said, "indeed old man, the child is safe and sound. <br>
    I was feeling pretty shaky and was gazing up the track,<br>
    Just then a pony galloped, the kid hopped on its back.
  </p>

  <p>
    "A blinding Bash of lightning then the thunder's rolling crack;<br>
    With two hands clasped upon his mane he raced towards the shack."<br>
    "Good heavens, man," I shouted then, "if that is truly so,<br>
    To blazes with the cattle, to the shanty we must go."<br>
    We reached Bill Hogan's shanty in fifteen minutes' ride,<br>
    Then left our horses standing and wildly rushed inside.
  </p>

  <p>
    The little child was there unhurt but shivering with fear,<br>
    And Hogan told us, "Yes, thank God, there's the pony brought her here."<br>
    There's a little worn-out pony just this side of Hogan's shack<br>
    With a snip upon his nuzzle and a mark upon his back;<br>
    Just a common little pony is what most people say,<br>
    But I doubt if there's his equal in the pony world today.
