    The news came down on the Castlereagh, and went to the world at large,<br>
    That twenty thousand travelling sheep, with Saltbush Bill in charge,<br>
    Were drifting down from a dried-out run to ravage the Castlereagh;<br>
    And the squatters swore when they heard the news, and wished they were well away:<br>
    For the name and the fame of Saltbush Bill were over the countryside<br>
    For the wonderful way that he fed his sheep, and the dodges and tricks he tried.<br>
    He would lose his way on a Main Stock Route, and stray to the squatters' grass;<br>
    He would come to a run with the boss away, and swear he had leave to pass;<br>
    And back of all and behind it all, as well the squatters knew,<br>
    If he had to fight, he would fight all day, so long as his sheep got through:<br>
    But this is the story of Stingy Smith, the owner of Hard Times Hill,<br>
    And the way that he chanced on a fighting man to reckon with Saltbush Bill.
  </p>

  <p>
    'Twas Stingy Smith on his stockyard sat, and prayed for an early spring,<br>
    When he stared at sight of a clean-shaved tramp, who walked with jaunty swing;<br>
    For a clean-shaved tramp with a jaunty walk a-swinging along the track<br>
    Is as rare a thing as a feathered frog on the desolate roads outback.<br>
    So the tramp he made for the traveler's' hut, and asked could he camp the night;<br>
    But Stingy Smith had a bright idea, and he said to him, "Can you fight?"<br>
    Why, what's the game?" said the clean-shaved tramp, as he looked at him up and down<br>
    "If you want a battle get off that fence, and I'll kill you for half-a-crown!<br>
    But boss you'd better not fight with me, it wouldn't be fair nor right;<br>
    I'm Stiffener Joe, from the Rocks Brigade, and I killed a man in a fight:<br>
    I served two years for it, fair and square, and now I'm a trampin' back,<br>
    To look for a peaceful quiet life away on the outside track -<br>
    "Oh, it's not myself, but a drover chap", said Stingy Smith with glee;<br>
    "A bullying fellow, called Saltbush Bill - and you are the man for me.<br>
    He's on the road with his hungry sheep, and he's certain to raise a row,<br>
    For he's bullied the whole of the Castlereagh till he's got them under cow -<br>
    Just pick a quarrel and raise a fight, and leather him good and hard<br>
    And 1'll take good care that his wretched sheep don't wander a half a yard.<br>
    Its a five pound job if you belt him well - do anything short of kill,<br>
    For there isn't a beak on the Castlereagh will fine you for Saltbush Bill."
  </p>

  <p>
    "I'll take the job " said the fighting man, "and hot as this cove appears,<br>
    He'll stand no chance with a bloke like me, what's lived on the game for years;<br>
    For he's maybe learnt in a boxing school, and sparred for a round or so,<br>
    But I've fought all hands in a ten foot ring each night in a travelling show;<br>
    They earnt a pound if they stayed three rounds, and they tried for it every night -<br>
    In a ten foot ring! Oh, that's the game that teaches a bloke to fight,<br>
    For they'd rush and clinch, it was Dublin Rules, and we drew no colour line;<br>
    And they all tried hard for to earn the pound, but they got no pound of mine:<br>
    If I saw no chance in the opening round I'd slog at their wind, and wait<br>
    Till an opening came - and it always came - and I settled 'em, sure as fate;<br>
    Left on the ribs and right on the jaw - and, when the chance comes, make sure!<br>
    And it's there a professional bloke like me gets home on an amateur:
  </p>

  <p>
    "For it's my experience every day, and I make no doubt it's yours,<br>
    That a third-class pro is an over-match for the best of the amateurs -<br>
    "Oh, take your swag to the traveler's' hut," said Smith, "for you waste your breath<br>
    You've a first-class chance if you lose the fight, of talking your man to death.<br>
    I'll tell the cook you're to have your grub, and see that you eat your fill,<br>
    And come to the scratch all fit and well to leather this Saltbush Bill."
  </p>

  <p>
    'Twas Saltbush Bill, and his travelling sheep were wending their weary way<br>
    On the Main Stock Route, through the Hard Times Run, on their six-mile stage a day;<br>
    And he strayed a mile from the Main Stock Route, and started to feed along,<br>
    And, when Stingy Smith came up, Bill said that the Route was surveyed wrong;<br>
    And he tried to prove that the sheep had rushed and strayed from their camp at night,<br>
    But the fighting man he kicked Bill's dog, and of course that meant a fight:
  </p>

  <p>
    So they sparred and fought, and they shifted ground and never a sound was heard<br>
    But the thudding fists on their brawny ribs, and the seconds' muttered word<br>
    Till the fighting man shot home his left on the ribs with a mighty clout,<br>
    And his right flashed up with a half-arm blow - and Saltbush Bill "went out".<br>
    He fell face down, and towards the blow - and their hearts with fear were filled<br>
    For he lay as still as a fallen tree, and they thought that he must be killed.
  </p>

  <p>
    So Stingy Smith and the fighting man, they lifted him from the ground,<br>
    And sent to home for a brandy flask, and they slowly fetched him round;<br>
    But his head was bad, and his jaw was hurt - in fact, he could scarcely speak -<br>
    So they let him spell till he got his wits, and he camped on the run a week,<br>
    While the travelling sheep went here and there, wherever they liked to stray,<br>
    Till Saltbush Bill was fit once more for the track to the Castlereagh.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then Stingy Smith he wrote a note and gave to the fighting man:<br>
    'Twas writ to the boss of the neighboring run, and thus the missive ran:<br>
    "The man with this is a fighting man, one Stiffener Joe by name;<br>
    He came near murdering Saltbush Bill, and I found it a costly game:<br>
    But it's worth your while to employ the chap, for there isn't the slightest doubt<br>
    You'll have no trouble from Saltbush Bill while this man hangs about -<br>
    But an answer came by the next week's mail, with news that might well appal:<br>
    "The man you sent with a note is not a fighting man at all!<br>
    He has shaved his beard, and has cut his hair, but I spotted him at a look;<br>
    He is Tom Devine, who has worked for years for Saltbush Bill as cook.<br>
    Bill coached him up in the fighting yarn, and taught him the tale by rote,<br>
    And they shammed to fight, and they got your grass and divided your five-pound note.<br>
    'Twas a clean take-in, and you'll find it wise - 'twill save you a lot of pelf -<br>
    When next you're hiring a fighting man, just fight him a round yourself."
  </p>

  <p>
    And the teamsters out on the Castlereagh, when they meet with a week of rain,<br>
    And the wagon sinks to its axle-tree, deep down in the black soil plain,<br>
    When the bullocks wade in a sea of mud, and strain at the load of wool,<br>
    And the cattle dogs at the bullocks' heels are biting to make them pull,<br>
    When the offside driver flays the team, and curses them while he flogs,<br>
    And the air is thick with the language used and the clamour of men and dogs -<br>
    The teamsters say, as they pause to rest and moisten each hairy throat<br>
    They wish they could swear like Stingy Smith when he read that neighbor's note.
