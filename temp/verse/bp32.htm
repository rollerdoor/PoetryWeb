  <p>
    It's grand to be a squatter<br>
    And sit upon a post,<br>
    And watch your little ewes and lambs<br>
    A-giving up the ghost.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's grand to be a `cockie'<br>
    With wife and kids to keep,<br>
    And find an all-wise Providence<br>
    Has mustered all your sheep.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's grand to be a Western man,<br>
    With shovel in your hand,<br>
    To dig your little homestead out<br>
    From underneath the sand.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's grand to be a shearer,<br>
    Along the Darling side,<br>
    And pluck the wool from stinking sheep<br>
    That some days since have died.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's grand to be a rabbit<br>
    And breed till all is blue,<br>
    And then to die in heaps because<br>
    There's nothing left to chew.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's grand to be a Minister<br>
    And travel like a swell,<br>
    And tell the Central District folk<br>
    To go to -- Inverell.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's grand to be a Socialist<br>
    And lead the bold array<br>
    That marches to prosperity<br>
    At seven bob a day.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's grand to be an unemployed<br>
    And lie in the Domain,<br>
    And wake up every second day<br>
    And go to sleep again.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's grand to borrow English tin<br>
    To pay for wharves and Rocks,<br>
    And then to find it isn't in<br>
    The little money-box.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's grand to be a democrat<br>
    And toady to the mob,<br>
    For fear that if you told the truth<br>
    They'd hunt you from your job.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's grand to be a lot of things<br>
    In this fair Southern land,<br>
    But if the Lord would send us rain,<br>
    That would, indeed, be grand!
