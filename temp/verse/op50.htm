  <p>
    The bleak-faced winter, with his braggart winds <br>
    (Coiled to his scrawny throat in tattered black), <br>
    Posts down the highway of his late domain, <br>
    His spurs like leeches in his bleeding hack.
  </p>

  <p>
    He rides to reach the huge embattled hills<br>
    Where all the brooding summer he may lie <br>
    Engulfed in Kosciusko's silent snow, <br>
    His shadow waving o'er the lofty sky.
  </p>

  <p>
    And jolly Spring, with love and laughter gay <br>
    Full fountaining, lets loose her tide of bees<br>
    Upon the waking ember-flame of bloom <br>
    New kindled in the honey-scented trees.
  </p>

  <p>
    The old, old man forsakes the chimney-hole, <br>
    Where erst he warmed his bones and lazy blood, <br>
    And, clasping Molly to his wheezing breast,<br>
    Triumphant floats, cock-whoop, upon the flood.
