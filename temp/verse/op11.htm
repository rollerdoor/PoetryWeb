  <p>
    Have you ever had a decent look at the species 'Aussie man.'<br>
    Both sexes I'm referring to - they roam throughout this land.<br>
    They're born at a very early age and suckle on their mothers breast,<br>
    And stay that way for at least a year until they give it best.
  </p>

  <p>
    By then they're at the toddlers stage, that's when they learn to walk.<br>
    And vain attempts are often made to teach them how to talk. <br>
    They're quite adept at bawling in a ruse to get their way,<br>
    Then plastic bits instead of tits soothes them through the day.
  </p>

  <p>
    Comes time for education, that's when television takes its turn,<br>
    Sesame Street and Kindy shows are the usual ways to learn.<br>
    When the nestling reaches three years old it's time for interaction,<br>
    They're taken from their homely nest into a pre-schools faction.
  </p>

  <p>
    From five the weanlings go to school until they reach their teens,<br>
    Advancing to Universities for more learned ones it seems.<br>
    The work-place finds a lot of them proudly building on their morals,<br>
    While the others tend to laze about resting on their laurels.
  </p>

  <p>
    The labour force shares all the toil - that's equality and fairness.<br>
    While educated yuppies vie for socio-political awareness.<br>
    The working class pays all the tax and supports the un-employed,<br>
    Who live a life of luxury on the coast-lines - melanoid.
  </p>

  <p>
    The breeding cycle then revolves, new fledglings make the scene,<br>
    The younger chicks are cleverer than their forebears so it seems.<br>
    They thrive on education and create communicative skills,<br>
    And wonder why their dads and mums were ever born such dills.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then we have the 'tink'-ie types; 'two incomes and no kids',<br>
    They won't have their life of leisure spoiled by screaming 'billy-lids'.<br>
    They respect each others earnings and live as man and spouse<br>
    And share the bills together in grand old terraced house.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then in their final years the species starts to lose its bloom,<br>
    Less care is taken in appearance, less time there is to groom.<br>
    They wear thongs or floppy sandals, take on a brand-new guise,<br>
    With baggy shorts and sloppy shirts, or track-suits oversized.
  </p>

  <p>
    And instead of settling down to rest after forty years of debt,<br>
    They grab their superannuation and try to get rid of it.<br>
    Instead of King-Gee working clothes or suits of blended wool,<br>
    They buy a flamin' four-wheel-drive and a caravan to pull.
  </p>

  <p>
    They migrate to the northern states to suck up sun and leisure,<br>
    And hide the fact from others that the van is all their treasure.<br>
    They make out that they're happy and would not be dead for quids,<br>
    And sit around a camp-fire - and skite about their kids.
  </p>
