<div class="verse">
  <p>
    There came a stranger to Walgett town,<br>
    To Walgett town when the sun was low,<br>
    And he carried a thirst that was worth a crown,<br>
    Yet how to quench it he did not know;<br>
    But he thought he might take those yokels down,<br>
    The guileless yokels of Walgett town.
  </p>

  <p>
    They made him a bet in a private bar,<br>
    In a private bar when the talk was high,<br>
    And they bet him some pounds no matter how far<br>
    He could pelt a stone, yet he could not shy<br>
    A stone right over the river so brown,<br>
    The Darling River at Walgett town.
  </p>

  <p>
    He knew that the river from bank to bank <br>
    Was fifty yards, and he smiled a smile<br>
    As he trundled down; but his hopes they sank, <br>
    For there wasn't a stone within fifty mile; <br>
    For the saltbush plain and the open down <br>
    Produce no quarries in Walgett town.
  </p>

  <p>
    The yokels laughed at his hopes o'erthrown, <br>
    And he stood awhile like a man in a dream; <br>
    Then out of his pocket he fetched a stone, <br>
    And pelted it over the silent stream<br>
    He'd been there before; he had wandered down <br>
    On a previous visit to Walgett town.
