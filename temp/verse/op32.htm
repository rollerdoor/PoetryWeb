    Yes; I'm Harry Black - Mad Harry - and I often hear 'em say:<br>
    "Oh! he's off, poor chap; don't heed him - he has seen a better day.<br>
    He was king of all the drovers on a dry and dusty track;<br>
    He tried it once too often; it's Mad Harry - Harry Black."
  </p>

  <p>
    I had got a mob of cattle out beyond the back Paroo,<br>
    When stock-routes were the paddocks and fences far and few,<br>
    And the track was dry as wisdom, and the days were scorching hot,<br>
    The beasts were dropping off like flies - I thought we'd lose the lot.
  </p>

  <p>
    And my mates were turning cranky - day and night without a drink -<br>
    But I kept 'em to the music, and I never slept a wink.<br>
    I had to keep 'em goin', or the beggars, beast and man,<br>
    Would have perished like a beetle in an empty billy-can.
  </p>

  <p>
    I woke and found, one mornin', there was not a hoof alive!<br>
    But I rode around the bodies and started on to drive -<br>
    They were bloomin' hard to manage, but I kept 'em all the same,<br>
    For whoever knows Mad Harry will admit that he is game.
  </p>

  <p>
    And I took 'em on my lonely, kept 'em movin' on the track,<br>
    Till the fellows who had left me one by one came sneakin' back,<br>
    And I never swore or cursed 'em - simply let'em take a hand,<br>
    Till the curious way they watched me brought me round to under-stand.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was drivin' ghosts o' cattle - not a live hoof in the lot! -<br>
    And they'd never camp a moment, though the day was blazin' hot,<br>
    And at night they never rested, always movin' movin' round,<br>
    With a restless sort o' movin' and a moanin' sort of sound.
  </p>

  <p>
    Till at last I swore at Murphy, cursed Joe Cowly to his teeth,<br>
    And I saw their lips a-grinnin' and a skeleton beneath!<br>
    I cursed 'em both as useless, and then all at once I saw<br>
    They had travelled with the cattle, and were livin' men no more!
  </p>

  <p>
    Ghosts o' men and ghosts o' cattle, I could see 'em through the day<br>
    In a strange and curious fashion and a hazy sort o' way;<br>
    And at night they gathered round me till my flesh was all a-creep,<br>
    And at last - I couldn't help it - while they watched I fell asleep.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then they went and left me sleepin' - went and left me where I lay,<br>
    And I swore an oath I'd find 'em if I looked till Judgment Day!<br>
    Yes, I'm Harry Black - Mad Harry - and I never can forget<br>
    Those pikers from the back Paroo - I'm looking for 'em yet!
