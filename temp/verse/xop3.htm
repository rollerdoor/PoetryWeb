  <p>
    With proud thanksgiving, a mother for her children,<br>
    England mourns for her dead across the sea.<br>
    Flesh of her flesh they were, spirit of her spirit,<br>
    Fallen in the cause of the free.
  </p>

  <p>
    Solemn in drums thrill: Death august and royal<br>
    Signs sorrow up into immortal spheres.<br>
    There is music in the midst of desolation<br>
    And a glory that shines upon our tears.
  </p>

  <p>
    They went with songs to the battle, they were young,<br>
    Straight of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow.<br>
    They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted,<br>
    They fell with their faces to the foe.
  </p>

  <p>
    They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old;<br>
    Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.<br>
    At the going down of the sun and in the morning<br>
    We will remember them.
  </p>

  <p>
    They mingle not with their laughing comrades again:<br>
    They sit no more at familiar tables at home;<br>
    They have no lot in our labor of the daytime;<br>
    They sleep beyond England's foam.
  </p>

  <p>
    But where our desires are and our hopes profound,<br>
    felt as a wellspring that is hidden from sight,<br>
    To the innermost heart of their own land they are known<br>
    As the stars that are known to the Night.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the stars that shall be bright when we are dust,<br>
    Moving in marches upon the heavenly plain,<br>
    As the stars that are starry in the time of our darkness,<br>
    to the end, to the end, they remain.
