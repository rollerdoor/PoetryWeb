  <p>
    I rode through the bush in the burning noon, <br>
    Over the hills to my bride,<br>
    The track was rough and the way was long,<br>
    And Bannerman of the Dandenong, <br>
    He rode along by my side.
  </p>

  <p>
    A day's march off my Beautiful dwelt,<br>
    By the Murray streams in the West;<br>
    Lightly lilting a gay love-song<br>
    Rode Bannerman of the Dandenong,<br>
    With a blood-red rose on his breast.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Red, red rose of the Western streams,"<br>
    Was the song he sang that day—<br>
    Truest comrade in hour of need, <br>
    Bay Mathinna his peerless steed—<br>
    I had my own good grey.
  </p>

  <p>
    There fell a spark on the upland grass-<br>
    The dry bush leapt into flame; <br>
    And I felt my heart go cold as death,<br>
    But Bannerman smiled and caught his breath, <br>
    But I heard him name her name.
  </p>

  <p>
    Down the hillside the fire-floods rushed,<br>
    On the roaring eastern wind;<br>
    Neck and neck was the reckless race, <br>
    Ever the bay mare kept her pace,<br>
    But the grey horse dropped behind.
  </p>

  <p>
    He turned in the saddle— "Let's change, I say!"<br>
    And his bridle rein he drew<br>
    He sprang to the ground, "Look sharp!" he said<br>
    With a backward toss of his curly head—<br>
    "I ride lighter than you!"</font>
  </p>

  <p>
    Down and up — it was quickly done—<br>
    No words to waste that day!<br>
    Swift as a swallow she sped along,<br>
    The good bay mare from Dandenong,<br>
    And Bannerman rode the grey.
  </p>

  <p>
    The hot air scorched like a furnace blast<br>
    From the very mouth of hell;<br>
    The blue gums caught and blazed on high<br>
    Like flaming pillars into the sky;<br>
    The gray horse staggered and fell.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Ride, ride, lad, ride for her sake!" he cried;<br>
    Into the gulf of flame<br>
    Were swept, in less than a breathing space<br>
    The laughing eyes, and the comely face,<br>
    And the lips that named her name.
  </p>

  <p>
    She bore me bravely, the good bay mare;<br>
    Stunned, and dizzy and blind;<br>
    I heard the sound of a mingling roar —<br>
    'Twas the Lachlan river that rushed before,<br>
    And the flames that rolled behind.
  </p>

  <p>
    Safe—safe, at Nammoora gate,<br>
    I fell, and lay like a stone.<br>
    O love! thine arms were about me then,<br>
    Thy warm tears called me to life again,<br>
    But — O God! that I came alone!
  </p>

  <p>
    We dwell in peace, my beautiful one<br>
    And I, by the streams of the West,<br>
    But oft through the mist of my dreams along<br>
    Rides Bannerman of the Dandenong,<br>
    With the blood-red rose on his breast.</font>
