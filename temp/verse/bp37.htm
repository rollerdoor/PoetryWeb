        This was the way of it, don't you know --<br>
        Ryan was `wanted' for stealing sheep,<br>
        And never a trooper, high or low,<br>
        Could find him -- catch a weasel asleep!<br>
        Till Trooper Scott, from the Stockman's Ford --<br>
        A bushman, too, as I've heard them tell --<br>
        Chanced to find him drunk as a lord<br>
        Round at the Shadow of Death Hotel.
    </p>

    <p>
        D'you know the place? It's a wayside inn,<br>
        A low grog-shanty -- a bushman trap,<br>
        Hiding away in its shame and sin<br>
        Under the shelter of Conroy's Gap --<br>
        Under the shade of that frowning range,<br>
        The roughest crowd that ever drew breath --<br>
        Thieves and rowdies, uncouth and strange,<br>
        Were mustered round at the Shadow of Death.
    </p>

    <p>
        The trooper knew that his man would slide<br>
        Like a dingo pup, if he saw the chance;<br>
        And with half a start on the mountain side<br>
        Ryan would lead him a merry dance.<br>
        Drunk as he was when the trooper came,<br>
        To him that did not matter a rap --<br>
        Drunk or sober, he was the same,<br>
        The boldest rider in Conroy's Gap.
    </p>

    <p>
        `I want you, Ryan,' the trooper said,<br>
        `And listen to me, if you dare resist,<br>
        So help me heaven, I'll shoot you dead!'<br>
        He snapped the steel on his prisoner's wrist,<br>
        And Ryan, hearing the handcuffs click,<br>
        Recovered his wits as they turned to go,<br>
        For fright will sober a man as quick<br>
        As all the drugs that the doctors know.
    </p>

    <p>
        There was a girl in that rough bar<br>
        Went by the name of Kate Carew,<br>
        Quiet and shy as the bush girls are,<br>
        But ready-witted and plucky, too.<br>
        She loved this Ryan, or so they say,<br>
        And passing by, while her eyes were dim<br>
        With tears, she said in a careless way,<br>
        `The Swagman's round in the stable, Jim.'
    </p>

    <p>
        Spoken too low for the trooper's ear,<br>
        Why should she care if he heard or not?<br>
        Plenty of swagmen far and near,<br>
        And yet to Ryan it meant a lot.<br>
        That was the name of the grandest horse<br>
        In all the district from east to west<br>
        In every show ring, on every course<br>
        They always counted the Swagman best.
    </p>

    <p>
        He was a wonder, a raking bay --<br>
        One of the grand old Snowdon strain --<br>
        One of the sort that could race and stay<br>
        With his mighty limbs and his length of rein.<br>
        Born and bred on the mountain side,<br>
        He could race through scrub like a kangaroo,<br>
        The girl herself on his back might ride,<br>
        And the Swagman would carry her safely through.
    </p>

    <p>
        He would travel gaily from daylight's flush<br>
        Till after the stars hung out their lamps,<br>
        There was never his like in the open bush,<br>
        And never his match on the cattle-camps.<br>
        For faster horses might well be found<br>
        On racing tracks, or a plain's extent,<br>
        But few, if any, on broken ground<br>
        Could see the way that the Swagman went.
    </p>

    <p>
        When this girl's father, old Jim Carew,<br>
        Was droving out on the Castlereagh<br>
        With Conroy's cattle, a wire came through<br>
        To say that his wife couldn't live the day.<br>
        And he was a hundred miles from home,<br>
        As flies the crow, with never a track,<br>
        Through plains as pathless as ocean's foam,<br>
        He mounted straight on the Swagman's back.
    </p>

    <p>
        He left the camp by the sundown light,<br>
        And the settlers out on the Marthaguy<br>
        Awoke and heard, in the dead of night,<br>
        A single horseman hurrying by.<br>
        He crossed the Bogan at Dandaloo,<br>
        And many a mile of the silent plain<br>
        That lonely rider behind him threw<br>
        Before they settled to sleep again.
    </p>

    <p>
        He rode all night and he steered his course<br>
        By the shining stars with a bushman's skill,<br>
        And every time that he pressed his horse<br>
        The Swagman answered him gamely still.<br>
        He neared his home as the east was bright,<br>
        The doctor met him outside the town:<br>
        `Carew! How far did you come last night?'<br>
        `A hundred miles since the sun went down.'
    </p>

    <p>
        And his wife got round, and an oath he passed,<br>
        So long as he or one of his breed<br>
        Could raise a coin, though it took their last<br>
        The Swagman never should want a feed.<br>
        And Kate Carew, when her father died,<br>
        She kept the horse and she kept him well:<br>
        The pride of the district far and wide,<br>
        He lived in style at the bush hotel.
    </p>

    <p>
        Such was the Swagman; and Ryan knew<br>
        Nothing about could pace the crack;<br>
        Little he'd care for the man in blue<br>
        If once he got on the Swagman's back.<br>
        But how to do it? A word let fall<br>
        Gave him the hint as the girl passed by;<br>
        Nothing but `Swagman -- stable-wall;<br>
        `Go to the stable and mind your eye.'
    </p>

    <p>
        He caught her meaning, and quickly turned<br>
        To the trooper: `Reckon you'll gain a stripe<br>
        By arresting me, and it's easily earned;<br>
        Let's go to the stable and get my pipe,<br>
        The Swagman has it.' So off they went,<br>
        And soon as ever they turned their backs<br>
        The girl slipped down, on some errand bent<br>
        Behind the stable, and seized an axe.
    </p>

    <p>
        The trooper stood at the stable door<br>
        While Ryan went in quite cool and slow,<br>
        And then (the trick had been played before)<br>
        The girl outside gave the wall a blow.<br>
        Three slabs fell out of the stable wall --<br>
        'Twas done 'fore ever the trooper knew --<br>
        And Ryan, as soon as he saw them fall,<br>
        Mounted the Swagman and rushed him through.
    </p>

    <p>
        The trooper heard the hoof-beats ring<br>
        In the stable yard, and he slammed the gate,<br>
        But the Swagman rose with a mighty spring<br>
        At the fence, and the trooper fired too late,<br>
        As they raced away and his shots flew wide<br>
        And Ryan no longer need care a rap,<br>
        For never a horse that was lapped in hide<br>
        Could catch the Swagman in Conroy's Gap.
    </p>

    <p>
        And that's the story. You want to know<br>
        If Ryan came back to his Kate Carew;<br>
        Of course he should have, as stories go,<br>
        But the worst of it is, this story's true:<br>
        And in real life it's a certain rule,<br>
        Whatever poets and authors say<br>
        Of high-toned robbers and all their school,<br>
        These horsethief fellows aren't built that way.
    </p>

    <p>
        Come back! Don't hope it -- the slinking hound,<br>
        He sloped across to the Queensland side,<br>
        And sold the Swagman for fifty pound,<br>
        And stole the money, and more beside.<br>
        And took to drink, and by some good chance<br>
        Was killed -- thrown out of a stolen trap.<br>
        And that was the end of this small romance,<br>
        The end of the story of Conroy's Gap.
