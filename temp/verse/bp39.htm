  <p>
    Born of a thoroughbred English race,<br>
    Well proportioned and closely knit,<br>
    Neat of figure and handsome face,<br>
    Always ready and always fit,<br>
    Hard and wiry of limb and thew,<br>
    That was the ne'er-do-well Jim Carew.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the sons of the good old land --<br>
    Many a year since his like was known;<br>
    Never a game but he took command,<br>
    Never a sport but he held his own;<br>
    Gained at his college a triple blue --<br>
    Good as they make them was Jim Carew.
  </p>

  <p>
    Came to grief -- was it card or horse?<br>
    Nobody asked and nobody cared;<br>
    Ship him away to the bush of course,<br>
    Ne'er-do-well fellows are easily spared;<br>
    Only of women a tolerable few<br>
    Sorrowed at parting with Jim Carew.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gentleman Jim on the cattle camp,<br>
    Sitting his horse with an easy grace;<br>
    But the reckless living has left its stamp<br>
    In the deep drawn lines of that handsome face,<br>
    And a harder look in those eyes of blue:<br>
    Prompt at a quarrel is Jim Carew.
  </p>

  <p>
    Billy the Lasher was out for gore --<br>
    Twelve-stone navvy with chest of hair,<br>
    When he opened out with a hungry roar<br>
    On a ten-stone man it was hardly fair;<br>
    But his wife was wise if his face she knew<br>
    By the time you were done with him, Jim Carew.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gentleman Jim in the stockmen's hut<br>
    Works with them, toils with them, side by side;<br>
    As to his past -- well, his lips are shut.<br>
    `Gentleman once,' say his mates with pride;<br>
    And the wildest Cornstalk can ne'er outdo<br>
    In feats of recklessness, Jim Carew.
  </p>

  <p>
    What should he live for? A dull despair!<br>
    Drink is his master and drags him down,<br>
    Water of Lethe that drowns all care.<br>
    Gentleman Jim has a lot to drown,<br>
    And he reigns as king with a drunken crew,<br>
    Sinking to misery, Jim Carew.
  </p>

  <p>
    Such is the end of the ne'er-do-well --<br>
    Jimmy the Boozer, all down at heel;<br>
    But he straightens up when he's asked to tell<br>
    His name and race, and a flash of steel<br>
    Still lightens up in those eyes of blue --<br>
    `I am, or -- no, I WAS -- Jim Carew.'
