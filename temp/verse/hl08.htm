<div class="verse">
  <p>
    Out West, where the stars are brightest,<br>
    Where the scorching north wind blows,<br>
    And the bones of the dead gleam whitest,<br>
    And the sun on a desert glows —<br>
    Yet within the selfish kingdom<br>
    Where man starves man for gain,<br>
    Where white men tramp for existence —<br>
    Wide lies the Great Grey Plain.</p>

  <p>No break in its awful horizon,<br>
    No blur in the dazzling haze,<br>
    Save where by the bordering timber<br>
    The fierce, white heat-waves blaze,<br>
    And out where the tank-heap rises<br>
    Or looms when the sunlights wane,<br>
    Till it seems like a distant mountain<br>
    Low down on the Great Grey Plain.</p>

  <p>No sign of a stream or fountain,<br>
    No spring on its dry, hot breast,<br>
    No shade from the blazing noontide<br>
    Where a weary man might rest.<br>
    Whole years go by when the glowing<br>
    Sky never clouds for rain —<br>
    Only the shrubs of the desert<br>
    Grow on the Great Grey Plain.</p>

  <p>From the camp, while the rich man's dreaming,<br>
    Come the `traveller' and his mate,<br>
    In the ghastly dawnlight seeming<br>
    Like a swagman's ghost out late;<br>
    And the horseman blurs in the distance,<br>
    While still the stars remain,<br>
    A low, faint dust-cloud haunting<br>
    His track on the Great Grey Plain.</ptd>

    <p>And all day long from before them<br>
      The mirage smokes away —<br>
      That daylight ghost of an ocean<br>
      Creeps close behind all day<br>
      With an evil, snake-like motion,<br>
      As the waves of a madman's brain:<br>
      'Tis a phantom NOT like water<br>
      Out there on the Great Grey Plain.</p>

    <p>There's a run on the Western limit<br>
      Where a man lives like a beast,<br>
      And a shanty in the mulga<br>
      That stretches to the East;<br>
      And the hopeless men who carry<br>
      Their swags and tramp in pain —<br>
      The footmen must not tarry<br>
      Out there on the Great Grey Plain.</p>

    <p>Out West, where the stars are brightest,<br>
      Where the scorching north wind blows,<br>
      And the bones of the dead seem whitest,<br>
      And the sun on a desert glows —<br>
      Out back in the hungry distance<br>
      That brave hearts dare in vain —<br>
      Where beggars tramp for existence —<br>
      There lies the Great Grey Plain.</p>

    <p>'Tis a desert not more barren<br>
      Than the Great Grey Plain of years,<br>
      Where a fierce fire burns the hearts of men —<br>
      Dries up the fount of tears:<br>
      Where the victims of a greed insane<br>
      Are crushed in a hell-born strife —<br>
      Where the souls of a race are murdered<br>
      On the Great Grey Plain of Life!</p>
