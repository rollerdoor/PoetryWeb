    We are the old-world people,<br>
    Ours were the hearts to dare;<br>
    But our youth is spent, and our backs are bent,<br>
    And the snow is on our hair.
  </p>

  <p>
    Back in the early fifties,<br>
    Dim through the mist of years,<br>
    By the bush-grown strand of a wild, strange land<br>
    We entered - the Pioneers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our axes rang in the woodlands,<br>
    Where the gaudy bush-birds flew,<br>
    And we turned the loam of our new-found home,<br>
    Where the eucalyptus grew.
  </p>

  <p>
    Housed in the rough log shanty,<br>
    Camped in the leaking tent,<br>
    From sea to view of the mountains blue,<br>
    Where the eager fossickers went.
  </p>

  <p>
    We wrought with a will unceasing,<br>
    We moulded, and fashioned, and planned,<br>
    And we fought with the black, and we blazed the track,<br>
    That ye might inherit the land.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here are your shops and churches,<br>
    Your cities of stucco and smoke;<br>
    And the swift trains fly, where the wild cat's cry<br>
    O'er the sad bush silence broke.
  </p>

  <p>
    Take now the fruit of our labour,<br>
    Nourish and guard it with care,<br>
    For our youth is spent, and our backs are bent.<br>
    And the snow is on our hair.
  </p>
