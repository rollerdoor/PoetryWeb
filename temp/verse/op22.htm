  <p>Our lager<br>
    Which art in barrels<br>
    Hallowed be thy drink<br>
    Thy will be drunk (I will be drunk)<br>
    At home as if in tavern<br>
    Give us this day our foamy head<br>
    And forgive us our spillages<br>
    As we forgive those who spill against us<br>
    And lead us not to incarceration<br>
    But deliver us from hangovers<br>
    For thine is the beer, the bitter, the lager<br>
    For ever and ever....
