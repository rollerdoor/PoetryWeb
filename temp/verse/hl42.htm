  <p>
    White handkerchiefs wave from the short black pier<br>
    As we glide to the grand old sea --<br>
    But the song of my heart is for none to hear<br>
    If one of them waves for me.<br>
    A roving, roaming life is mine,<br>
    Ever by field or flood --<br>
    For not far back in my father's line<br>
    Was a dash of the Gipsy blood.
  </p>

  <p>
    Flax and tussock and fern,<br>
    Gum and mulga and sand,<br>
    Reef and palm -- but my fancies turn<br>
    Ever away from land;<br>
    Strange wild cities in ancient state,<br>
    Range and river and tree,<br>
    Snow and ice. But my star of fate<br>
    Is ever across the sea.
  </p>

  <p>
    A god-like ride on a thundering sea,<br>
    When all but the stars are blind --<br>
    A desperate race from Eternity<br>
    With a gale-and-a-half behind.<br>
    A jovial spree in the cabin at night,<br>
    A song on the rolling deck,<br>
    A lark ashore with the ships in sight,<br>
    Till -- a wreck goes down with a wreck.
  </p>

  <p>
    A smoke and a yarn on the deck by day,<br>
    When life is a waking dream,<br>
    And care and trouble so far away<br>
    That out of your life they seem.<br>
    A roving spirit in sympathy,<br>
    Who has travelled the whole world o'er --<br>
    My heart forgets, in a week at sea,<br>
    The trouble of years on shore.
  </p>

  <p>
    A rolling stone! -- 'tis a saw for slaves --<br>
    Philosophy false as old --<br>
    Wear out or break 'neath the feet of knaves,<br>
    Or rot in your bed of mould!<br>
    But I'D rather trust to the darkest skies<br>
    And the wildest seas that roar,<br>
    Or die, where the stars of Nations rise,<br>
    In the stormy clouds of war.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cleave to your country, home, and friends,<br>
    Die in a sordid strife --<br>
    You can count your friends on your finger ends<br>
    In the critical hours of life.<br>
    Sacrifice all for the family's sake,<br>
    Bow to their selfish rule!<br>
    Slave till your big soft heart they break --<br>
    The heart of the family fool.
  </p>

  <p>
    Domestic quarrels, and family spite,<br>
    And your Native Land may be<br>
    Controlled by custom, but, come what might,<br>
    The rest of the world for me.<br>
    I'd sail with money, or sail without! --<br>
    If your love be forced from home,<br>
    And you dare enough, and your heart be stout,<br>
    The world is your own to roam.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've never a love that can sting my pride,<br>
    Nor a friend to prove untrue;<br>
    For I leave my love ere the turning tide,<br>
    And my friends are all too new.<br>
    The curse of the Powers on a peace like ours,<br>
    With its greed and its treachery --<br>
    A stranger's hand, and a stranger land,<br>
    And the rest of the world for me!
  </p>

  <p>
    But why be bitter? The world is cold<br>
    To one with a frozen heart;<br>
    New friends are often so like the old,<br>
    They seem of the past a part --<br>
    As a better part of the past appears,<br>
    When enemies, parted long,<br>
    Are come together in kinder years,<br>
    With their better nature strong.
  </p>

  <p>
    I had a friend, ere my first ship sailed,<br>
    A friend that I never deserved --<br>
    For the selfish strain in my blood prevailed<br>
    As soon as my turn was served.<br>
    And the memory haunts my heart with shame --<br>
    Or, rather, the pride that's there;<br>
    In different guises, but soul the same,<br>
    I meet him everywhere.
  </p>

  <p>
    I had a chum. When the times were tight<br>
    We starved in Australian scrubs;<br>
    We froze together in parks at night,<br>
    And laughed together in pubs.<br>
    And I often hear a laugh like his<br>
    From a sense of humour keen,<br>
    And catch a glimpse in a passing phiz<br>
    Of his broad, good-humoured grin.
  </p>

  <p>
    And I had a love -- 'twas a love to prize --<br>
    But I never went back again . . .<br>
    I have seen the light of her kind brown eyes<br>
    In many a face since then.
  </p>

  <p>
    The sailors say 'twill be rough to-night,<br>
    As they fasten the hatches down,<br>
    The south is black, and the bar is white,<br>
    And the drifting smoke is brown.<br>
    The gold has gone from the western haze,<br>
    The sea-birds circle and swarm --<br>
    But we shall have plenty of sunny days,<br>
    And little enough of storm.
  </p>

  <p>
    The hill is hiding the short black pier,<br>
    As the last white signal's seen;<br>
    The points run in, and the houses veer,<br>
    And the great bluff stands between.<br>
    So darkness swallows each far white speck<br>
    On many a wharf and quay.<br>
    The night comes down on a restless deck, --<br>
    Grim cliffs -- and -- The Open Sea
