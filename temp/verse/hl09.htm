  <p>
    Fire lighted; on the table a meal for sleepy men;<br>
    A lantern in the stable; a jingle now and then;<br>
    The mail-coach looming darkly by light of moon and star;<br>
    The growl of sleepy voices; a candle in the bar;<br>
    A stumble in the passage of folk with wits abroad;<br>
    A swear-word from a bedroom — the shout of "All aboard!"<br>
    "Tchk-tchk! Git-up!" "Hold fast, there!" and down the range we go;<br>
    Five hundred miles of scattered camps will watch for Cobb and Co.</p>

  <p>Old coaching towns already decaying for their sins;<br>
    Uncounted "Half-Way Houses", and scores of "Ten-Mile Inns";<br>
    The riders from the stations by lonely granite peaks;<br>
    The black-boy for the shepherds on sheep and cattle creeks;<br>
    The roaring camps of Gulgong, and many a "Digger's Rest";<br>
    The diggers on the Lachlan; the huts of Farthest West;<br>
    Some twenty thousand exiles who sailed for weal or woe —<br>
    The bravest hearts of twenty lands will wait for Cobb and Co.</p>

  <p>The morning star has vanished, the frost and fog are gone,<br>
    In one of those grand mornings which but on mountains dawn;<br>
    A flask of friendly whisky — each other's hopes we share — <br>
    And throw our top-coats open to drink the mountain air.<br>
    The roads are rare to travel, and life seems all complete;<br>
    The grind of wheels on gravel, the trot of horses' feet,<br>
    The trot, trot, trot and canter, as down the spur we go —<br>
    The green sweeps to horizons blue that call for Cobb and Co.</p>

  <p>We take a bright girl actress through western dusts and damps,<br>
    To bear the home-world message, and sing for sinful camps,<br>
    To stir our hearts and break them, wild hearts that hope and ache —<br>
    (Ah! when she thinks again of these her own must nearly break!)<br>
    Five miles this side the goldfield, a loud, triumphant shout:<br>
    Five hundred cheering diggers have snatched the horses out:<br>
    With "Auld Lang Syne" in chorus, through roaring camps they go<br>
    That cheer for her, and cheer for Home, and cheer for Cobb and Co.</p>

  <p>Three lamps above the ridges and gorges dark and deep,<br>
    A flash on sandstone cuttings where sheer the sidlings sweep,<br>
    A flash on shrouded wagons, on water ghastly white;<br>
    Weird bush and scattered remnants of "rushes in the night";<br>
    Across the swollen river a flash beyond the ford:<br>
    Ride hard to warn the driver! He's drunk or mad, good Lord!<br>
    But on the bank to westward a broad and cheerful glow —<br>
    New camps extend across the plains, new routes for Cobb and Co.</p>

  <p>Swift scramble up the sidling where teams climb inch by inch;<br>
    Pause, bird-like, on the summit — then breakneck down the pinch;<br>
    By clear ridge-country rivers, and gaps where tracks run high,<br>
    Where waits the lonely horseman, cut clear against the sky;<br>
    Past haunted half-way houses — where convicts made the bricks —<br>
    Scrub-yards and new bark shanties, we dash with five and six;<br>
    Through stringybark and blue-gum, and box and pine we go —<br>
    A hundred miles shall see tonight the lights of Cobb and Co!</p>
