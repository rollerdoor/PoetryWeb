    A Dream of the Melbourne Cup

<div class="verse">
  <p>
    Bring me a quart of colonial beer<br>
    And some doughy damper to make good cheer,<br>
    I must make a heavy dinner;<br>
    Heavily dine and heavily sup,<br>
    Of indigestible things fill up,<br>
    Next month they run the Melbourne Cup,<br>
    And I have to dream the winner.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stoke it in, boys! the half-cooked ham,<br>
    The rich ragout and the charming cham.,<br>
    I've got to mix my liquor;<br>
    Give me a gander's gaunt hind leg,<br>
    Hard and tough as a wooden peg,<br>
    And I'll keep it down with a hard-boiled egg,<br>
    'Twill make me dream the quicker.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now I am full of fearful feed,<br>
    Now I may dream a race indeed,<br>
    In my restless, troubled slumber;<br>
    While the night-mares race through my heated brain<br>
    And their devil-riders spur amain,<br>
    The tip for the Cup will reward my pain,<br>
    And I'll spot the winning number.
  </p>

  <p>*****</p>

  <p>Thousands and thousands and thousands more,<br>
    Like sands on the white Pacific shore,<br>
    The crowding people cluster;<br>
    For evermore it's the story old,<br>
    While races are bought and backers are sold,<br>
    Drawn by the greed of the gain of gold,<br>
    In their thousands still they muster.
  </p>

  <p>
    And the bookies' cries grow fierce and hot,<br>
    "I'll lay the Cup! The double, if not!"<br>
    "Five monkeys, Little John, sir!"<br>
    "Here's fives bar one, I lay, I lay!"<br>
    And so they shout through the livelong day,<br>
    And stick to the game that is sure to pay,<br>
    While fools put money on, sir!
  </p>

  <p>
    And now in my dream I seem to go<br>
    And bet with a "book" that I seem to know -<br>
    A Hebrew money-lender;<br>
    A million to five is the price I get -<br>
    Not bad! but before I book the bet<br>
    The horse's name I clean forget,<br>
    Its number and even gender.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now for the start, and here they come,<br>
    And the hoof-strokes roar like a mighty drum<br>
    Beat by a hand unsteady;<br>
    They come like a rushing, roaring flood,<br>
    Hurrah for the speed of the Chester blood;<br>
    For Acme is making the pace so good<br>
    There are some of 'em done already.
  </p>

  <p>But round the back she begins to tire,<br>
    And a mighty shout goes up "Crossfire!"<br>
    The magpie jacket's leading;<br>
    And Crossfire challenges, fierce and bold,<br>
    And the lead she'll have and the lead she'll hold,<br>
    But at length gives way to the black and gold,<br>
    Which away to the front is speeding.
  </p>

  <p>
    Carry them on and keep it up -<br>
    A flying race is the Melbourne Cup,<br>
    You must race and stay to win it;<br>
    And old Commotion, Victoria's pride,<br>
    Now takes the lead with his raking stride,<br>
    And a mighty roar goes far and wide -<br>
    "There's only Commotion in it!"
  </p>

  <p>
    But one draws out from the beaten ruck<br>
    And up on the rails by a piece of luck<br>
    He comes in a style that's clever;<br>
    "It's Trident! Trident! Hurrah for Hales!"<br>
    "Go at 'em now while their courage fails;"<br>
    "Trident! Trident! for New South Wales!"<br>
    "The blue and white for ever!"
  </p>

  <p>
    Under the whip! with the ears flat back,<br>
    Under the whip! though the sinews crack,<br>
    No sign of the base white feather;<br>
    Stick to it now for your breeding's sake,<br>
    Stick to it now though your hearts should break,<br>
    While the yells and roars make the grand-stand shake,<br>
    They come down the straight together.
  </p>

  <p>Trident slowly forges ahead,<br>
    The fierce whips cut and the spurs are red,<br>
    The pace is undiminished;<br>
    Now for the Panics that never fail!<br>
    But many a backer's face grows pale<br>
    As old Commotion swings his tail<br>
    And swerves - and the Cup is finished.
  </p>

  <p>******</p>

  <p>
    And now in my dream it all comes back:<br>
    I bet my coin on the Sydney crack,<br>
    A million I've won, no question!<br>
    "Give me my money, you hooked-nosed hog!<br>
    Give me my money, bookmaking dog!"<br>
    But he disappeared in a kind of fog,<br>
    And I woke with "the indigestion".
