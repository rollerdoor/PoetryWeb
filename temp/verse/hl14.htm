  <p>
    An hour before the sun goes down<br>
    Behind the ragged boughs,<br>
    I go across the little run<br>
    And bring the dusty cows;<br>
    And once I used to sit and rest<br>
    Beneath the fading dome,<br>
    For there was one that I loved best<br>
    Who'd bring the cattle home.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our yard is fixed with double bails,<br>
    Round one the grass is green,<br>
    The bush is growing through the rails,<br>
    The spike is rusted in;<br>
    And 'twas from there his freckled face<br>
    Would turn and smile at me --<br>
    He'd milk a dozen in the race<br>
    While I was milking three.
  </p>

  <p>
    I milk eleven cows myself<br>
    Where once I milked but four;<br>
    I set the dishes on the shelf<br>
    And close the dairy door;<br>
    And when the glaring sunlight fails<br>
    And the fire shines through the cracks,<br>
    I climb the broken stockyard rails<br>
    And watch the bridle-tracks.
  </p>

  <p>
    He kissed me twice and once again<br>
    And rode across the hill,<br>
    The pint-pots and the hobble-chain<br>
    I hear them jingling still;<br>
    He'll come at night or not at all --<br>
    He left in dust and heat,<br>
    And when the soft, cool shadows fall<br>
    Is the best time to meet.
  </p>

  <p>
    And he is coming back again,<br>
    He wrote to let me know,<br>
    The floods were in the Darling then --<br>
    It seems so long ago;<br>
    He'd come through miles of slush and mud,<br>
    And it was weary work,<br>
    The creeks were bankers, and the flood<br>
    Was forty miles round Bourke.
  </p>

  <p>
    He said the floods had formed a block,<br>
    The plains could not be crossed,<br>
    And there was foot-rot in the flock<br>
    And hundreds had been lost;<br>
    The sheep were falling thick and fast<br>
    A hundred miles from town,<br>
    And when he reached the line at last<br>
    He trucked the remnant down.</p>

  <p>
    And so he'll have to stand the cost;<br>
    His luck was always bad,<br>
    Instead of making more, he lost<br>
    The money that he had;<br>
    And how he'll manage, heaven knows<br>
    (My eyes are getting dim),<br>
    He says -- he says -- he don't -- suppose<br>
    I'll want -- to -- marry -- him.</p>

  <p>
    As if I wouldn't take his hand<br>
    Without a golden glove --<br>
    Oh! Jack, you men won't understand<br>
    How much a girl can love.<br>
    I long to see his face once more --<br>
    Jack's dog! thank God, it's Jack! --<br>
    (I never thought I'd faint before)<br>
    He's coming -- up -- the track.
