<div class="verse">
  <p>
    Though poor and in trouble I wander alone,<br>
    With a rebel cockade in my hat;<br>
    Though friends may desert me, and kindred disown,<br>
    My country will never do that!<br>
    You may sing of the Shamrock, the Thistle, the Rose,<br>
    Or the three in a bunch, if you will;<br>
    But I know of a country that gathered all those,<br>
    And I love the great land where the Waratah grows,<br>
    And the Wattle-bough blooms on the hill.</p>

  <p>Australia! Australia! so fair to behold -<br>
    While the blue sky is arching above;<br>
    The stranger should never have need to be told,<br>
    That the Wattle-bloom means that her heart is of gold,<br>
    And the Waratah's red with her love.</p>

  <p>Australia! Australia! most beautiful name,<br>
    Most kindly and bountiful land;<br>
    I would die every death that might save her from shame,<br>
    If a black cloud should rise on the strand;<br>
    But whatever the quarrel, whoever her foes,<br>
    Let them come! Let them come when they will!<br>
    Though the struggle be grim, 'tis Australia that knows<br>
    That her children shall fight while the Waratah grows,<br>
    And the Wattle blooms out on the hill.</p>
