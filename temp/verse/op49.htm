  <p>
    From my window I can see, <br>
    Where the sandhills dip, <br>
    One far glimpse of open sea. <br>
    Just a slender slip <br>
    Curving like a crescent moon â€” <br>
    Yet a greater prize <br>
    Than the harbour garden-fair <br>
    Spread beneath my eyes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Just below me swings the bay, <br>
    Sings a sunny tune, <br>
    But my heart is far away <br>
    Out beyond the dune; <br>
    Clearer far the sea-gulls' cry <br>
    And the breakers' roar, <br>
    Than the little waves beneath <br>
    Lapping on the shore.
  </p>

  <p>
    For that strip of sapphire sea <br>
    Set against the sky <br>
    Far horizons means to me' <br>
    And the ships go by <br>
    Framed between the empty sky <br>
    And the yellow sands, <br>
    While my freed thoughts follow them <br>
    Out to other lands.
  </p>

  <p>
    All its changes who can tell?<br>
    I have seen it shine <br>
    Like a jewel polished well, <br>
    Hard and clear and fine; <br>
    Then soft lilac'and again <br>
    On another day <br>
    Glimpsed it through a veil of rain, <br>
    Shifting, drifting grey.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the livid waters flee, <br>
    Flinching from the storm, <br>
    From my window I can see, <br>
    Standing safe and warm, <br>
    How the white foam tosses high <br>
    On the naked shore, <br>
    And the breakers' thunder grows <br>
    To a battle-roar...
  </p>

  <p>
    Far and far I look'Ten miles? <br>
    No, for yesterday <br>
    Sure I saw the Blessed Isles <br>
    Twenty worlds away. <br>
    My blue moon of open sea, <br>
    Is it little worth? <br>
    At the least it gives to me <br>
    Keys of all the earth!
