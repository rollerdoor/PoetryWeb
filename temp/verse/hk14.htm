  <p>
    I would sit at your feet for long days,<br>
    To hear the sweet Muse of the Wild<br>
    Speak out through the sad and the passionate lays<br>
    Of her first and her favourite Child.
  </p>

  <p>
    I would sit at your feet, for my soul<br>
    Delights in the solitudes free;<br>
    And I stand where the creeks and the cataracts roll<br>
    Whensoever I listen to thee!
  </p>

  <p>
    I would sit at your feet, for I love<br>
    By the gulches and torrents to roam;<br>
    And I long in this city for woodland and grove,<br>
    And the peace of a wild forest home.
  </p>

  <p>
    I would sit at your feet, and we'd dwell<br>
    On the scenes of a long-vanished time,<br>
    While your thoughts into music would surge and would swell<br>
    Like a breeze of our beautiful clime.
  </p>

  <p>
    I would sit at your feet, for I know,<br>
    Though the World in the Present be blind,<br>
    That the amaranth blossoms of Promise will blow<br>
    When the Ages have left you behind.
  </p>

  <p>
    I would sit at your feet, for I feel<br>
    I am one of a glorious band<br>
    That ever will own you and hold you their Chief,<br>
    And a Monarch of Song in the land!
