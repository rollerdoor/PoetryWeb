  <p>
    North Country, filled with gesturing wood,<br>
    With trees that fence, like archers' volleys,<br>
    The flanks of hidden valleys<br>
    Where nothing's left to hide
  </p>

  <p>
    But verticals and perpendiculars,<br>
    Like rain gone wooden, fixed in falling,<br>
    Or fingers blindly feeling<br>
    For what nobody cares;
  </p>

  <p>
    Or trunks of pewter, bangled by greedy death,<br>
    Stuck with black staghorns, quietly sucking,<br>
    And trees whose boughs go seeking,<br>
    And tress like broken teeth
  </p>

  <p>
    With smoky antlers broken in the sky;<br>
    Or trunks that lie grotesquely rigid,<br>
    Like bodies blank and wretched<br>
    After a fool's battue,
  </p>

  <p>
    As if they've secret ways of dying here<br>
    And secret places for their anguish<br>
    When boughs at last relinquish<br>
    Their clench of blowing air
  </p>

  <p>
    But this gaunt country, filled with mills and saws,<br>
    With butter-works and railway-stations<br>
    And public institutions,<br>
    And scornful rumps of cows,
  </p>

  <p>
    North Country, filled with gesturing woodï¿½<br>
    Timber's the end it gives to branches,<br>
    Cut off in cubic inches,<br>
    Dripping red with blood.
