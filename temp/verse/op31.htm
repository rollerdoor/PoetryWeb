    We've drunk our wine, we've kissed our girls, and funds are sinking low,<br>
    The horses must be thinking it's a fair thing now to go;<br>
    Sling the swags on Condamine and strap the billies fast,<br>
    And stuff a bottle in the bags and let's be off at last.
  </p>

  <p>
    What matter if the creeks are up - the cash, alas, runs down!<br>
    A very sure and certain sign we're long enough in town.<br>
    The black fella rides the boko, and you'd better take the bay,<br>
    Quart Pot will do to carry me the stage we go today.
  </p>

  <p>
    No grass this side the Border fence! and all the mulga's dead!<br>
    The horses for a day or two will have to spiel ahead;<br>
    Man never yet from Queensland brought a bullock or a back<br>
    But lost condition on that God-abandoned Border track.
  </p>

  <p>
    When once we're through the rabbit-proof - it's certain since the rain -<br>
    There's whips o' grass and water, so, it's West by North again!<br>
    There's feed on Tyson's country - we can "spell" the mokes a week<br>
    Where Billy Stevens last year trapped his brumbies on Bough Creek.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Paroo may be quickly crossed - the Eulo Common's bare;<br>
    And, anyhow, it isn't wise, old man! to dally there.<br>
    Alack-a-day! far wiser men than you and I succumb<br>
    To woman's wiles, and potency of Queensland wayside rum.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then over sand and spinifex and on, o'er ridge and plain!<br>
    The nags are fresh - besides, they know they're westward-bound again.<br>
    The brand upon old Darkie's thigh is that upon the hide<br>
    Of bullocks we must muster on the Diamantina side.
  </p>

  <p>
    We'll light our camp-fires where we may,
    and yarn beside their blaze;<br>
    The jingling hobble-chains shall make a music through the days.<br>
    And while the tucker-bags are right, and we've a stick of weed,<br>
    A swagman shall be welcome to a pipe-full and a feed.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, fill your pipe! and, ere we mount, we'll drink another nip -<br>
    Here's how that West by North again may prove a lucky trip;<br>
    Then back again - I trust you'll find your best girl's merry face,<br>
    Or, if she jilts you, may you get a better in her place.
