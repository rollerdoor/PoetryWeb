    The Last Muster

<div class="verse">
  <p>
    All day we had driven the starving sheep to the scrub where the axes ply,<br>
    And the weakest had lagged upon weary feet and dropped from the ranks to die;<br>
    And the crows Hew up from the rotting heaps and the ewes too weak to stand,<br>
    And the fences Haunted red skins like flags, and the dour drought held the land.
  </p>

  <p>
    And at night as I lay a-dreaming, I woke, and a silver moon<br>
    Shone fair on a dancing river and laughed to a broad lagoon,<br>
    And the grass turned over the fences and rippled like ripening grain,<br>
    And clouds hung low on the hilltops, and earth smelt sweet with the rain.
  </p>

  <p>
    And in at the open window the lowing of cattle came -<br>
    A mob that had never a laggard and never a beast that was lame;<br>
    And wethers, a thousand thousand, and ewes with their lambs beside,<br>
    Moved over the green flats feeding, spread river to ranges wide.
  </p>

  <p>
    And horses whinnied below me, and leaning I watched them pass,<br>
    Lusty and strong and playful like horses on spring-tide grass<br>
    When they whinny one to another, strong-voiced, and a gallop brings<br>
    Foam to the Hank, be it only from paddock to stockyard wings.
  </p>

  <p>Slowly they moved in the moon-mist, heads low in the cool night-dew,<br>
    Snatching the long bush grasses, breast-high as they wandered through;<br>
    Slowly they moved in the moon-mist, and never a horse on the plains<br>
    Was red with the gall of the collar or marked with a chafe of the chains.
  </p>

  <p>
    And behind them a hundred drovers rode slow on their horses white,<br>
    All brave with their trappings of silver that Hashed in the silver light;<br>
    Buckle and stirrup and bridle, and spurs for their better speed -<br>
    Singing behind the cattle like drovers on royal feed.
  </p>

  <p>
    And I cooeed, and one came over that rode on the nearest wing,<br>
    And I called to him, "Ho, there, drover! say, whose is the mob you bring?"<br>
    Then he reined his horse by the window, all silver-bitted and shod,<br>
    And spoke, and his words rang sadly, "These are the cattle of God!"
  </p>

  <p>
    So I said to him, "Where are they bound for?" and he raised his hand to the West:<br>
    They are bound for the star-fenced pastures on God's own rivers, to rest."<br>
    And I asked him "Where did you muster?" and he answered me sadly again,<br>
    "From every gully and sandhill, from every valley and plain,
  </p>

  <p>
    "From the swamps of the green kapunyah, from the reeds at the red creek-side,<br>
    From the thickets of twisted mulga, from the clay-pans furrowed and dried,<br>
    From the track to the Western goldfields, from the ruts of the Great North Road,<br>
    Where the dingoes go and the crows fly low we have gathered the beasts of God."
  </p>

  <p>
    And I said, "Then has God repented because that He sent no rain?<br>
    And has God looked down in His pity on the poor dumb beasts He has slain?"<br>
    But the drover turned in his saddle and answered, his eyes in mine,<br>
    "Not so; for the beasts were slaughtered by man of his greed's design:
  </p>

  <p>
    "God gave to them feed and water and pastures so wild and wide<br>
    They had fed him a thousand million from here to the ocean side;<br>
    But man in his greed came after and fenced them on hill and plain<br>
    And cursed the God in His heaven that would not send them His rain;
  </p>

  <p>
    "And man's be the blame of the bleaching bone and the shame of the rotting hide,<br>
    And the pity of lorn lambs crying alone on the wind-swept mountain-side,<br>
    Of the weak horse down in his harness, of the bullock dead by the dray,<br>
    Of the moan of the thirsty cattle for ever and ever and aye!"
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="ital">
      And he spoke to his steed and left me - moved out on the mist
      it seemed,<br>
      And I woke to the red burned acres, and knew that I had but dreamed.
