  <p>
    There was an agile sailor lad<br>
    Who longed to know the bush<br>
    So with his swag and billy-can<br>
    He said he'd make a push.<br>
    He left his ship in Moreton Bay<br>
    And faced the Western run,<br>
    And asked his way, ten times a day,<br>
    And steered for Bandy's Run.
  </p>

  <p>
    Said Bandy: "You can start, my son,<br>
    If you can ride a horse,"<br>
    For stockmen on the cattle-run<br>
    Were wanted there, of course.<br>
    Now Jack had strode the cross-bars oft<br>
    On many a bounding sea,<br>
    So reckoned he'd be safe enough<br>
    On any moke you see.
  </p>

  <p>
    They caught him one and saddled it,<br>
    And led it from the yard,<br>
    It champed a bit and sidled round<br>
    And at the sailor sparred.<br>
    Jack towed her to him with a grin,<br>
    He eyed her fore and aft;<br>
    Then thrust his foot the gangway in<br>
    And swung aboard the craft.
  </p>

  <p>
    The watchers tumbled off the rail,<br>
    The boss lay down and roared,<br>
    While Jack held tight by mane and tail<br>
    And rocked about on board.<br>
    But still he clung as monkeys cling<br>
    To rudder, line and flap,<br>
    Although at every bound and spring<br>
    They thought his neck must snap.
  </p>

  <p>
    They stared to see him stick aloft<br>
    - The brum. bucked fierce and free,<br>
    But he had strode the cross-bars oft<br>
    On many a rolling sea.<br>
    The saddle from the rolling back<br>
    Went spinning in mid-air,<br>
    Whilst two big boots were flung off Jack<br>
    And four shoes off the mare.
  </p>

  <p>
    The bridle broke and left her free,<br>
    He grasped her round the neck;<br>
    "We're 'mong the breakers now," cried he,<br>
    "There's bound to be a wreck."<br>
    The brumby struck and snorted loud,<br>
    She reared and pawed the air,<br>
    It was the grandest sight the crowd<br>
    Had ever witnessed there.
  </p>

  <p>
    For Jack with arms and legs held tight<br>
    The brumby's neck hung round<br>
    And yelled, "A pilot, quick as light,<br>
    Or strike me I'm aground."<br>
    The whites and blacks climbed on the rails,<br>
    The boss stood smiling by<br>
    As Jack exclaimed, "Away she sails!"<br>
    - The brum. began to fly.
  </p>

  <p>
    She bounded first against the gate,<br>
    And Jack cried out, "Astern!"<br>
    Then struck a whirlpool - at any rate<br>
    That was the sailor's yarn.<br>
    The brumby spun him round and round,<br>
    She reared and'kicked and struck,<br>
    And with alternate bump and bound<br>
    In earnest began to buck.
  </p>

  <p>
    A tree loomed on the starboard bow,<br>
    And "Port your helm!" cried he;<br>
    She fouled a bush and he roared "You scow!"<br>
    And "Keep to the open sea!"<br>
    From ears to tail he rode her hard,<br>
    From tail to ears again,<br>
    One mile beyond the cattle-yard<br>
    And back across the plain.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now high upon the pommel bumped,<br>
    Now clinging on the side,<br>
    And on behind the saddle lumped<br>
    With arms and legs flung wide.<br>
    They only laughed the louder then<br>
    When the mare began to back<br>
    Until she struck the fence at last<br>
    Then sat and looked at Jack.
  </p>

  <p>
    He gasped, "I'm safe in port at last,<br>
    I'll quit your bounding mane!"<br>
    Dropped off and sang, "All danger's passed<br>
    And Jack's come home again."<br>
    Old Jack has been a stockman now<br>
    On Bandy's Run for years<br>
    Yet memories of that morning's fun<br>
    To many still bring tears.
