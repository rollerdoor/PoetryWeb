  <p>
    Old Father Pat! They'll tell you still with mingled love and pride<br>
    Of stirring deeds that live and thrill the quiet country-side;<br>
    And when they praise his tours-de-force, be sure it won't be long<br>
    Before they talk about his horse-the old grey Currajong.
  </p>

  <p>
    For twenty years he drove him through the bush and round the town,<br>
    Until the old white stager knew the parish upside down;<br>
    He'd take his time, and calculate, and have his wilful way,<br>
    And stop at every Catholic gate to bid them all good day.
  </p>

  <p>
    But well I mind the stories told when Father Pat was young<br>
    At least, when he was not so old-his scattered flock among;<br>
    When health and strength were on his side, you'd see him swing along<br>
    With that clean, easy, sweeping stride that marked old Currajong.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through all the years he ne'er was late the second Mass to say,<br>
    And twenty miles he'd "duplicate," and pass us on the way.<br>
    Hard-held and beating clean tattoos, the old gray, stepping kind,<br>
    Like gravel from his twinkling shoes would fling the miles behind.
  </p>

  <p>
    And often some too daring lad, a turn of speed to show,<br>
    Would straighten up his sleepy prad and give the priest a "go";<br>
    But, faith, he found what others found, and held the lesson long,<br>
    That nothing in the country round could move with Currajong.
  </p>

  <p>
    And, oh, the din I and, oh, the fuss! mere words were vain to tell<br>
    Of how they stopped the night with us; and don't I mind it well?<br>
    The boree-log ablaze "inside ' and gay with rug and mat;<br>
    The "front room," to the world denied, made snug for Father Pat.
  </p>

  <p>
    We knew his distant hoof-beats; ay, and grief they could forebode;<br>
    So, when we heard a horse go by, clean-stepping down the road,<br>
    Round many a log-fire burning bright there passed the word along,<br>
    "There's someone sick and sore the night; I'll bet that's Currajong."
  </p>

  <p>
    Whereat you'd hear the old men tell-perhaps a trifle add-<br>
    Of some sick-call remembered well, when "soand-so took bad."<br>
    "You couldn't see your hand in front." "'Twas rainin' pitchforks, too."<br>
    "The doctor fibbed, to put it blunt-but Father Pat went through."
  </p>

  <p>
    Ay, he went through in shine or shade; so, when the days were fair,<br>
    And at our simple sports we played, 'twas good to see him there;<br>
    And under troubled, angry skies, when all the world went wrong,<br>
    With aching hearts and misted eyes we watched for Currajong.
  </p>

  <p>
    We watched, and never watched in vain, whatever might befall.<br>
    When summoned to the bed of pain, he answered to the call.<br>
    He came through rain or storm or heat; and in the darkest night<br>
    We heard his hoofs the music beat, we saw the welcome light.
  </p>

  <p>
    And when again, with plumes ahead and horses stepping slow,<br>
    We followed on, behind our dead, the road all men must go,<br>
    A loitering line, with knots and gaps, the funeral passed along,<br>
    And half a mile of lurching traps was led by Currajong.
  </p>

  <p>
    But, as the good priest older grew, and aches and troubles came,<br>
    His buggy and the white horse, too, were stricken much the same.<br>
    The springs went down the side he sat, and altarboys and such<br>
    Kept sliding in on Father Pat, and woke him at the touch.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then, pensioned off at last and done, a sorry thing it stood,<br>
    With sagging cobwebs round it spun, and nesteggs in the hood.<br>
    Just once a year it lived again, and groaned and creaked along<br>
    To fetch the bishop from the train with limping Currajong.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ah, newer methods, younger men I the times are moving fast,<br>
    And but in dreams we tread again the wheelruts of the past;<br>
    The eyes are filmed that watched of old, the kindly hearts are still,<br>
    And silent tombstones white and cold are glimmering on the hill,
  </p>

  <p>
    While scorching up the road, belike, with singing gears alive<br>
    The curate on his motor-bike hits up his fortyfive;<br>
    But tender, tingling memories swell, and love will linger long<br>
    In all the stirring yarns they tell about Old Currajong.
