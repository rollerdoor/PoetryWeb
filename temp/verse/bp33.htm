  <p>
    The London lights are far abeam<br>
    Behind a bank of cloud,<br>
    Along the shore the gaslights gleam,<br>
    The gale is piping loud;<br>
    And down the Channel, groping blind,<br>
    We drive her through the haze<br>
    Towards the land we left behind --<br>
    The good old land of `never mind',<br>
    And old Australian ways.
  </p>

  <p>
    The narrow ways of English folk<br>
    Are not for such as we;<br>
    They bear the long-accustomed yoke<br>
    Of staid conservancy:<br>
    But all our roads are new and strange,<br>
    And through our blood there runs<br>
    The vagabonding love of change<br>
    That drove us westward of the range<br>
    And westward of the suns.
  </p>

  <p>
    The city folk go to and fro<br>
    Behind a prison's bars,<br>
    They never feel the breezes blow<br>
    And never see the stars;<br>
    They never hear in blossomed trees<br>
    The music low and sweet<br>
    Of wild birds making melodies,<br>
    Nor catch the little laughing breeze<br>
    That whispers in the wheat.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our fathers came of roving stock<br>
    That could not fixed abide:<br>
    And we have followed field and flock<br>
    Since e'er we learnt to ride;<br>
    By miner's camp and shearing shed,<br>
    In land of heat and drought,<br>
    We followed where our fortunes led,<br>
    With fortune always on ahead<br>
    And always further out.
  </p>

  <p>
    The wind is in the barley-grass,<br>
    The wattles are in bloom;<br>
    The breezes greet us as they pass<br>
    With honey-sweet perfume;<br>
    The parakeets go screaming by<br>
    With flash of golden wing,<br>
    And from the swamp the wild-ducks cry<br>
    Their long-drawn note of revelry,<br>
    Rejoicing at the Spring.
  </p>

  <p>
    So throw the weary pen aside<br>
    And let the papers rest,<br>
    For we must saddle up and ride<br>
    Towards the blue hill's breast;<br>
    And we must travel far and fast<br>
    Across their rugged maze,<br>
    To find the Spring of Youth at last,<br>
    And call back from the buried past<br>
    The old Australian ways.
  </p>

    When Clancy took the drover's track<br>
    In years of long ago,<br>
    He drifted to the outer back<br>
    Beyond the Overflow;<br>
    By rolling plain and rocky shelf,<br>
    With stockwhip in his hand,<br>
    He reached at last, oh lucky elf,<br>
    The Town of Come-and-help-yourself<br>
    In Rough-and-ready Land.
  </p>

  <p>
    And if it be that you would know<br>
    The tracks he used to ride,<br>
    Then you must saddle up and go<br>
    Beyond the Queensland side --<br>
    Beyond the reach of rule or law,<br>
    To ride the long day through,<br>
    In Nature's homestead -- filled with awe<br>
    You then might see what Clancy saw<br>
    And know what Clancy knew.
