  <p>
    One day old Trooper Campbell<br>
    Rode out to Blackman's Run,<br>
    His cap-peak and his sabre<br>
    Were glancing in the sun.<br>
    'Twas New Year's Eve, and slowly<br>
    Across the ridges low<br>
    The sad Old Year was drifting<br>
    To where the old years go.</p>

  <p>The trooper's mind was reading<br>
    The love-page of his life —<br>
    His love for Mary Wylie<br>
    Ere she was Blackman's wife;<br>
    He sorrowed for the sorrows<br>
    Of the heart a rival won,<br>
    For he knew that there was trouble<br>
    Out there on Blackman's Run.</p>

  <p>The sapling shades had lengthened,<br>
    The summer day was late,<br>
    When Blackman met the trooper<br>
    Beyond the homestead gate.<br>
    And if the hand of trouble<br>
    Can leave a lasting trace,<br>
    The lines of care had come to stay<br>
    On poor old Blackman's face.</p>

  <p>`Not good day, Trooper Campbell,<br>
    It's a bad, bad day for me —<br>
    You are of all the men on earth<br>
    The one I wished to see.<br>
    The great black clouds of trouble<br>
    Above our homestead hang;<br>
    That wild and reckless boy of mine<br>
    Has joined M'Durmer's gang.</p>

  <p>`Oh! save him, save him, Campbell!<br>
    I beg in friendship's name!<br>
    For if they take and hang him,<br>
    The wife would die of shame.<br>
    Could Mary or her sisters<br>
    Hold up their heads again,<br>
    And face a woman's malice<br>
    Or claim the love of men?</p>

  <p>`And if he does a murder<br>
    'Twere better we were dead.<br>
    Don't take him, Trooper Campbell,<br>
    If a price be on his head;<br>
    But shoot him! shoot him, Campbell,<br>
    When you meet him face to face,<br>
    And save him from the gallows,<br>
    And us from that disgrace.'</p>

  <p>`Now, Tom,' cried Trooper Campbell,<br>
    `You know your words are wild.<br>
    Though he is wild and reckless,<br>
    Yet still he is your child;<br>
    So bear up in your trouble,<br>
    And meet it like a man,<br>
    And tell the wife and daughters<br>
    I'll save him if I can.'</p>

  <p>The sad Australian sunset<br>
    Had faded from the west;<br>
    But night brings darker shadows<br>
    To hearts that cannot rest;<br>
    And Blackman's wife sat rocking<br>
    And moaning in her chair.<br>
    `I cannot bear disgrace,' she moaned;<br>
    `Disgrace I cannot bear.</p>

  <p>`In hardship and in trouble<br>
    I struggled year by year<br>
    To make my children better<br>
    Than other children here.<br>
    And if my son's a felon<br>
    How can I show my face?<br>
    I cannot bear disgrace; my God,<br>
    I cannot bear disgrace!</td>

    <p>`Ah, God in Heaven pardon!<br>
      I'm selfish in my woe —<br>
      My boy is better-hearted<br>
      Than many that I know.<br>
      And I will face the world's disgrace,<br>
      And, till his mother's dead,<br>
      My foolish child shall find a place<br>
      To lay his outlawed head.'

      <p>With a sad heart Trooper Campbell<br>
        Rode back from Blackman's Run,<br>
        Nor noticed aught about him<br>
        Till thirteen miles were done;<br>
        When, close beside a cutting,<br>
        He heard the click of locks,<br>
        And saw the rifle muzzles<br>
        Were on him from the rocks.</p>

      <p>But suddenly a youth rode out,<br>
        And, close by Campbell's side:<br>
        `Don't fire! don't fire, in heaven's name!<br>
        It's Campbell, boys!' he cried.<br>
        Then one by one in silence<br>
        The levelled rifles fell,<br>
        For who'd shoot Trooper Campbell<br>
        Of those who knew him well?</p>

      <p>Oh, bravely sat old Campbell,<br>
        No sign of fear showed he.<br>
        He slowly drew his carbine;<br>
        It rested by his knee.<br>
        The outlaws' guns were lifted,<br>
        But none the silence broke,<br>
        Till steadfastly and firmly<br>
        Old Trooper Campbell spoke.</p>

      <p>`That boy that you would ruin<br>
        Goes home with me, my men;<br>
        Or some of us shall never<br>
        Ride through the Gap again.<br>
        You know old Trooper Campbell,<br>
        And have you ever heard<br>
        That bluff or lead could turn him,<br>
        That e'er he broke his word?</p>

      <p>`That reckless lad is playing<br>
        A heartless villain's part;<br>
        He knows that he is breaking<br>
        His poor old mother's heart.<br>
        He'll bring a curse upon himself;<br>
        But 'tis not that alone,<br>
        He'll bring dishonour to a name<br>
        That I'D be proud to own.</p>

      <p>`I speak to you, M'Durmer, —<br>
        If your heart's not hardened quite,<br>
        And if you'd seen the trouble<br>
        At Blackman's home this night,<br>
        You'd help me now, M'Durmer —<br>
        I speak as man to man —<br>
        I swore to save that foolish lad,<br>
        And I'll save him if I can.'</p>

      <p>`Oh, take him!' said M'Durmer,<br>
        `He's got a horse to ride.'<br>
        The youngster thought a moment,<br>
        Then rode to Campbell's side —<br>
        `Good-bye!' the outlaws shouted,<br>
        As up the range they sped.<br>
        `A Merry New Year, Campbell,'<br>
        Was all M'Durmer said.</p>

      <p>Then fast along the ridges<br>
        Two bushmen rode a race,<br>
        And the moonlight lent a glory<br>
        To Trooper Campbell's face.<br>
        And ere the new year's dawning<br>
        They reached the home at last;<br>
        And this is but a story<br>
        Of trouble that is past!</p>
