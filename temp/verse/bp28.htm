<div class="verse">
    <p>
        Not for the love of women toil we, we of the craft,<br>
        Not for the people's praise;<br>
        Only because our goddess made us her own and laughed,<br>
        Claiming us all our days,
    </p>

    <p>
        Claiming our best endeavour--body and heart and brain<br>
        Given with no reserve--<br>
        Niggard is she towards us, granting us little gain;<br>
        Still, we are proud to serve.
    </p>

    <p>
        Not unto us is given choice of the tasks we try,<br>
        Gathering grain or chaff;<br>
        One of her favoured servants toils at an epic high,<br>
        One, that a child may laugh.
    </p>

    <p>
        Yet if we serve her truly in our appointed place,<br>
        Freely she doth accord<br>
        Unto her faithful servants always this saving grace,<br>
        Work is its own reward!
        <br>
