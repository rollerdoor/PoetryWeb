    Celestial poesy! whose genial sway<br>
    Earth's furthest habitable shores obey;<br>
    Whose inspirations shed their sacred light,<br>
    Far as the regions of the Arctic night,<br>
    And to the Laplander his Boreal gleam<br>
    Endear not less than Phoebus' brighter beam, —<br>
    Descend thou also on my native land,<br>
    And on some mountain-summit take thy stand;<br>
    Thence issuing soon a purer font be seen<br>
    Than charmed Castalia or famed Hippocrene;<br>
    And there a richer, nobler fane arise,<br>
    Than on Parnassus met the adoring eyes.<br>
    And tho', bright goddess, on the far blue hills,<br>
    That pour their thousand swift pellucid rills<br>
    Where Warragamba's rage has rent in twain<br>
    Opposing mountains, thundering to the plain,<br>
    No child of song has yet invoked thy aid<br>
    'Neath their primeval solitary shade, —<br>
    Still, gracious Pow'r, some kindling soul inspire,<br>
    To wake to life my country's unknown lyre,<br>
    That from creation's date has slumbering lain,<br>
    Or only breathed some savage uncouth strain;<br>
    And grant that yet an Austral Milton's song<br>
    Pactolus-like flow deep and rich along, —<br>
    An Austral Shakespeare rise, whose living page<br>
    To nature true may charm in ev'ry age; —<br>
    And that an Austral Pindar daring soar,<br>
    Where not the Theban eagle reach'd before.<br>
    And, O Britannia! shouldst thou cease to ride<br>
    Despotic Empress of old Ocean's tide; —<br>
    Should thy tamed Lion — spent his former might, —<br>
    No longer roar the terror of the fight; —<br>
    Should e'er arrive that dark disastrous hour,<br>
    When bow'd by luxury, thou yield'st to pow'r; —<br>
    When thou, no longer freest of the free,<br>
    To some proud victor bend'st the vanquish'd knee; —<br>
    May all thy glories in another sphere<br>
    Relume, and shine more brightly still than here;<br>
    May this, thy last-born infant, then arise,<br>
    To glad thy heart and greet thy parent eyes;<br>
    And Australasia float, with flag unfurl'd,<br>
    A new Britannia in another world.
