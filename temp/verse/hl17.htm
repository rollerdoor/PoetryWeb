    We boast no more of our bloodless flag, that rose from a nation's slime;<br>
    Better a shred of a deep-dyed rag from the storms of the olden time.<br>
    From grander clouds in our `peaceful skies' than ever were there before<br>
    I tell you the Star of the South shall rise — in the lurid clouds of war.<br>
    It ever must be while blood is warm and the sons of men increase;<br>
    For ever the nations rose in storm, to rot in a deadly peace.<br>
    There comes a point that we will not yield, no matter if right or wrong,<br>
    And man will fight on the battle-field<br>
    while passion and pride are strong —<br>
    So long as he will not kiss the rod, and his stubborn spirit sours,<br>
    And the scorn of Nature and curse of God are heavy on peace like ours.

    There are boys out there by the western creeks, who hurry away from school<br>
    To climb the sides of the breezy peaks or dive in the shaded pool,<br>
    Who'll stick to their guns when the mountains quake<br>
    to the tread of a mighty war,<br>
    And fight for Right or a Grand Mistake as men never fought before;<br>
    When the peaks are scarred and the sea-walls crack<br>
    till the furthest hills vibrate,<br>
    And the world for a while goes rolling back in a storm of love and hate.
  </p>

  <p>*****</p>

  <p>
    There are boys to-day in the city slum and the home of wealth and pride<br>
    Who'll have one home when the storm is come, and fight for it side by side,<br>
    Who'll hold the cliffs 'gainst the armoured hells<br>
    that batter a coastal town,<br>
    Or grimly die in a hail of shells when the walls come crashing down.<br>
    And many a pink-white baby girl, the queen of her home to-day,<br>
    Shall see the wings of the tempest whirl the mist of our dawn away —<br>
    Shall live to shudder and stop her ears to the thud of the distant gun,<br>
    And know the sorrow that has no tears when a battle is lost and won, —<br>
    As a mother or wife in the years to come, will kneel, wild-eyed and white,<br>
    And pray to God in her darkened home for the `men in the fort to-night'.
  </p>

    But, oh! if the cavalry charge again as they did when the world was wide,<br>
    'Twill be grand in the ranks of a thousand men<br>
    in that glorious race to ride<br>
    And strike for all that is true and strong,<br>
    for all that is grand and brave,<br>
    And all that ever shall be, so long as man has a soul to save.<br>
    He must lift the saddle, and close his `wings', and shut his angels out,<br>
    And steel his heart for the end of things,<br>
    who'd ride with a stockman scout,<br>
    When the race they ride on the battle track, and the waning distance hums,<br>
    And the shelled sky shrieks or the rifles crack<br>
    like stockwhip amongst the gums —<br>
    And the `straight' is reached and the field is `gapped'<br>
    and the hoof-torn sward grows red<br>
    With the blood of those who are handicapped with iron and steel and lead;<br>
    And the gaps are filled, though unseen by eyes,<br>
    with the spirit and with the shades<br>
    Of the world-wide rebel dead who'll rise and rush with the Bush Brigades.
  </p>

    All creeds and trades will have soldiers there —<br>
    give every class its due —<br>
    And there'll be many a clerk to spare for the pride of the jackeroo.<br>
    They'll fight for honour and fight for love, and a few will fight for gold,<br>
    For the devil below and for God above, as our fathers fought of old;<br>
    And some half-blind with exultant tears, and some stiff-lipped, stern-eyed,<br>
    For the pride of a thousand after-years and the old eternal pride;<br>
    The soul of the world they will feel and see<br>
    in the chase and the grim retreat —<br>
    They'll know the glory of victory — and the grandeur of defeat.<br>
    The South will wake to a mighty change ere a hundred years are done<br>
    With arsenals west of the mountain range and every spur its gun.<br>
    And many a rickety son of a gun, on the tides of the future tossed,<br>
    Will tell how battles were really won that History says were lost,<br>
    Will trace the field with his pipe, and shirk<br>
    the facts that are hard to explain,<br>
    As grey old mates of the diggings work the old ground over again —<br>
    How `this was our centre, and this a redoubt,<br>
    and that was a scrub in the rear,<br>
    And this was the point where the guards held out,<br>
    and the enemy's lines were here.'

    They'll tell the tales of the nights before<br>
    and the tales of the ship and fort<br>
    Till the sons of Australia take to war as their fathers took to sport,<br>
    Their breath come deep and their eyes grow bright<br>
    at the tales of our chivalry,<br>
    And every boy will want to fight, no matter what cause it be —<br>
    When the children run to the doors and cry:<br>
    `Oh, mother, the troops are come!'<br>
    And every heart in the town leaps high at the first loud thud of the drum.<br>
    They'll know, apart from its mystic charm, what music is at last,<br>
    When, proud as a boy with a broken arm, the regiment marches past.<br>
    And the veriest wreck in the drink-fiend's clutch,<br>
    no matter how low or mean,<br>
    Will feel, when he hears the march, a touch<br>
    of the man that he might have been.
  </p>

  <p>
    And fools, when the fiends of war are out and the city skies aflame,<br>
    Will have something better to talk about than an absent woman's shame,<br>
    Will have something nobler to do by far than jest at a friend's expense,<br>
    Or blacken a name in a public bar or over a backyard fence.<br>
    And this you learn from the libelled past,<br>
    though its methods were somewhat rude —<br>
    A nation's born where the shells fall fast, or its lease of life renewed.<br>
    We in part atone for the ghoulish strife,<br>
    and the crimes of the peace we boast,<br>
    And the better part of a people's life in the storm comes uppermost.
  </p>

  <p>
    The self-same spirit that drives the man to the depths of drink and crime<br>
    Will do the deeds in the heroes' van that live till the end of time.<br>
    The living death in the lonely bush, the greed of the selfish town,<br>
    And even the creed of the outlawed push is chivalry — upside down.<br>
    'Twill be while ever our blood is hot, while ever the world goes wrong,<br>
    The nations rise in a war, to rot in a peace that lasts too long.<br>
    And southern nation and southern state, aroused from their dream of ease,<br>
    Must sign in the Book of Eternal Fate their stormy histories.
