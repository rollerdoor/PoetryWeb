  <p>
    You may have heard of Proclus, sir,<br>
    If you have been a reader;<br>
    And you may know a bit of her<br>
    Who helped the Lycian leader.
  </p>

  <p>I
    have my doubts — the head you "sport"<br>
    (Now mark me, don't get crusty)<br>
    Is hardly of the classic sort —<br>
    Your lore, I think, is fusty.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most likely you have stuck to tracts<br>
    Flushed through with flaming curses —<br>
    I judge you, neighbour, by your acts —<br>
    So don't you damn my verses.
  </p>

  <p>
    But to my theme. The Asian sage,<br>
    Whose name above I mention,<br>
    Lived in the pitchy Pagan age,<br>
    A life without pretension.
  </p>

  <p>
    He may have worshipped gods like Zeus,<br>
    And termed old Dis a master;<br>
    But then he had a strong excuse —<br>
    He never heard a pastor.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, it occurs to me<br>
    That, had he cut Demeter<br>
    And followed you, or followed me,<br>
    He wouldn't have been sweeter.
  </p>

  <p>
    No doubt with "shepherds" of
    this time<br>
    He's not the "clean potato",<br>
    Because — excuse me for my rhyme —<br>
    He pinned his faith to Plato.
  </p>

  <p>
    But these are facts you can't deny,<br>
    My pastor, smudged and sooty,<br>
    His mind was like a summer sky —<br>
    He lived a life of beauty —
  </p>

  <p>
    To lift his brothers' thoughts above<br>
    This earth he used to labour:<br>
    His heart was luminous with love —<br>
    He didn't wound his neighbour.
  </p>

  <p>
    To him all men were just the same —<br>
    He never foamed at altars,<br>
    Although he lived ere Moody came —<br>
    Ere Sankey dealt in psalters.
  </p>

  <p>The Lycian sage, my "reverend" sir,<br>
    Had not your chances ample;<br>
    But, after all, I must prefer<br>
    His perfect, pure example.
  </p>

  <p>
    You, having read the Holy Writ —<br>
    The Book the angels foster —<br>
    Say have you helped us on a bit,<br>
    You overfed impostor?
  </p>

  <p>
    What have you done to edify,<br>
    You clammy chapel tinker?<br>
    What act like his of days gone by —<br>
    The grand old Asian thinker?
  </p>

  <p>
    Is there no deed of yours at all<br>
    With beauty shining through it?<br>
    Ah, no! your heart reveals its gall<br>
    On every side I view it.
  </p>

  <p>A blatant bigot with a big<br>
    Fat heavy fetid carcass,<br>
    You well become your greasy "rig" —<br>
    You're not a second Arcas.
  </p>

  <p>What sort of "gospel" do you preach?<br>
    What "Bible" is your Bible?<br>
    There's worse than wormwood in your speech,<br>
    You livid, living libel!
  </p>

  <p>
    How many lives are growing gray<br>
    Through your depraved behaviour!<br>
    I tell you plainly — every day<br>
    You crucify the Saviour!
  </p>

  <p>
    Some evil spirit curses you —<br>
    Your actions never vary:<br>
    You cannot point your finger to<br>
    One fact to the contrary.
  </p>

  <p>You seem to have a wicked joy<br>
    In your malicious labour,<br>
    Endeavouring daily to destroy<br>
    The neighbour's love for neighbour.
  </p>

  <p>
    The brutal curses you eject<br>
    Make strong men dread to hear you.<br>
    The world outside your petty sect<br>
    Feels sick when it is near you.
  </p>

  <p>
    No man who shuns that little hole<br>
    You call your tabernacle<br>
    Can have, you shriek, a ransomed soul —<br>
    He wears the devil's shackle.
  </p>

  <p>
    And, hence the "Papist" by your clan<br>
    Is dogged with words inhuman,<br>
    Because he loves that friend of man<br>
    The highest type of woman —
  </p>

  <p>
    Because he has that faith which sees<br>
    Before the high Creator<br>
    A Virgin pleading on her knees —<br>
    A shining Mediator!
  </p>

  <p>
    God help the souls who grope in night —<br>
    Who in your ways have trusted!<br>
    I've said enough! the more I write,<br>
    The more I feel disgusted.
  </p>

  <p>
    The warm, soft air is tainted through<br>
    With your pernicious leaven.<br>
    I would not live ~one hour~ with you<br>
    In your peculiar heaven!
  </p>

  <p>
    Now mount your musty pulpit — thump,<br>
    And muddle flat clodhoppers;<br>
    And let some long-eared booby "hump"<br>
    The plate about for coppers.
  </p>

  <p>
    At priest and parson spit and bark,<br>
    And shake your "church" with curses,<br>
    You bitter blackguard of the dark —<br>
    With this I close my verses.
  </p>
