<div class="verse">
  <p>
    My road is fenced with the bleached, white bones<br>
    And strewn with the blind, white sand,<br>
    Beside me a suffering, dumb world moans<br>
    On the breast of a lonely land.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the rim of the world the lightnings play,<br>
    The heat-waves quiver and dance,<br>
    And the breath of the wind is a sword to slay<br>
    And the sunbeams each a lance.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have withered the grass where my hot hoofs tread,<br>
    I have whitened the sapless trees,<br>
    I have driven the faint-heart rains ahead<br>
    To hide in their soft green seas.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have bound the plains with an iron band,<br>
    I have stricken the slow streams dumb!<br>
    To the charge of my vanguards who shall stand?<br>
    Who stay when my cohorts come?
  </p>

  <p>
    The dust-storms follow and wrap me round;<br>
    The hot winds ride as a guard;<br>
    Before me the fret of the swamps is bound<br>
    And the way of the wild-fowl barred.
  </p>

  <p>
    I drop the whips on the loose-flanked steers;<br>
    I burnt their necks with the bow;<br>
    And the green-hide rips and the iron sears<br>
    Where the staggering, lean beasts go.
  </p>

  <p>
    I lure the swagman out of the road<br>
    To the gleam of a phantom lake;<br>
    I have laid him down, I have taken his load,<br>
    And he sleeps till the dead men wake.
  </p>

  <p>
    My hurrying hoofs in the night go by,<br>
    And the great flocks bleat their fear<br>
    And follow the curve of the creeks burnt dry<br>
    And the plains scorched brown and sere.
  </p>

  <p>
    The worn men start from their sleepless rest<br>
    With faces haggard and drawn;<br>
    They cursed the red Sun into the west<br>
    And they curse him out of the dawn.
  </p>

  <p>
    They have carried their outposts far, far out,<br>
    But - blade of my sword for a sign! -<br>
    I am the Master, the dread King Drought,<br>
    And the great West Land is mine!
