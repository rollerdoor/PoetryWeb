    Only one old post is standing -<br>
    Solid yet, but only one -<br>
    Where the milking, and the branding,<br>
    And the slaughtering were done.<br>
    Later years have brought dejection,<br>
    Care, and sorrow; but we knew<br>
    Happy days on that selection<br>
    Underneath old Bukaroo.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then the light of day commencing<br>
    Found us at the gully's head,<br>
    Splitting timber for the fencing,<br>
    Stripping bark to roof the shed.<br>
    Hands and hearts the labour strengthened;<br>
    Weariness we never knew,<br>
    Even when the shadows lengthened<br>
    Round the base of Bukaroo.
  </p>

  <p>
    There for days below the paddock<br>
    How the wilderness would yield<br>
    To the spade, and pick, and mattock,<br>
    While we toiled to win the field.<br>
    Bronzed hands we used to sully<br>
    Till they were of darkest hue,<br>
    `Burning off' down in the gully<br>
    At the back of Bukaroo.
  </p>

  <p>
    When we came the baby brother<br>
    Left in haste his broken toys,<br>
    Shouted to the busy mother:<br>
    `Here is dadda and the boys!'<br>
    Strange it seems that she was able<br>
    For the work that she would do;<br>
    How she'd bustle round the table<br>
    In the hut 'neath Bukaroo!
  </p>

  <p>
    When the cows were safely yarded,<br>
    And the calves were in the pen,<br>
    All the cares of day discarded,<br>
    Closed we round the hut-fire then.<br>
    Rang the roof with boyish laughter<br>
    While the flames o'er-topped the flue;<br>
    Happy days remembered after -<br>
    Far away from Bukaroo.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the years were full of changes,<br>
    And a sorrow found us there;<br>
    For our home amid the ranges<br>
    Was not safe from searching Care.<br>
    On he came, a silent creeper;<br>
    And another mountain threw<br>
    O'er our lives a shadow deeper<br>
    Than the shade of Bukaroo.
  </p>

  <p>
    All the farm is disappearing;<br>
    For the home has vanished now,<br>
    Mountain scrub has choked the clearing,<br>
    Hid the furrows of the plough.<br>
    Nearer still the scrub is creeping<br>
    Where the little garden grew;<br>
    And the old folks now are sleeping<br>
    At the foot of Bukaroo.
