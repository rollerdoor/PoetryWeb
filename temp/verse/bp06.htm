  <p>
    Where the serpents are in millions, all of the most deadly stamp;<br>
    Where the station-cook in terror, nearly every time he bakes,<br>
    Mixes up among the doughboys half-a-dozen poison-snakes:<br>
    Where the wily free-selector walks in armour-plated pants,<br>
    And defies the stings of scorpions, and the bites of bull-dog ants:<br>
    Where the adder and the viper tear each other by the throat,<br>
    There it was that William Johnson sought his snake-bite antidote.
  </p>

  <p>
    Johnson was a free-selector, and his brain went rather queer,<br>
    For the constant sight of serpents filled him with a deadly fear;<br>
    So he tramped his free-selection, morning, afternoon, and night,<br>
    Seeking for some great specific that would cure the serpent's bite.<br>
    Till King Billy, of the Mooki, chieftain of the flour-bag head,<br>
    Told him, `Spos'n snake bite pfeller, pfeller mostly drop down dead;<br>
    Spos'n snake bite old goanna, then you watch a while you see,<br>
    Old goanna cure himself with eating little pfeller tree.'<br>
    `That's the cure,' said William Johnson, `point me out this plant sublime,'<br>
    But King Billy, feeling lazy, said he'd go another time.<br>
    Thus it came to pass that Johnson, having got the tale by rote,<br>
    Followed every stray goanna, seeking for the antidote.
  </p>

  <p>
    Loafing once beside the river, while he thought his heart would break,<br>
    There he saw a big goanna fighting with a tiger-snake,<br>
    In and out they rolled and wriggled, bit each other, heart and soul,<br>
    Till the valiant old goanna swallowed his opponent whole.<br>
    Breathless, Johnson sat and watched him, saw him struggle up the bank,<br>
    Saw him nibbling at the branches of some bushes, green and rank;<br>
    Saw him, happy and contented, lick his lips, as off he crept,<br>
    While the bulging in his stomach showed where his opponent slept.<br>
    Then a cheer of exultation burst aloud from Johnson's throat;<br>
    `Luck at last,' said he, `I've struck it! 'tis the famous antidote.'
  </p>

  <p>
    `Here it is, the Grand Elixir, greatest blessing ever known,<br>
    Twenty thousand men in India die each year of snakes alone.<br>
    Think of all the foreign nations, negro, chow, and blackamoor,<br>
    Saved from sudden expiration, by my wondrous snakebite cure.<br>
    It will bring me fame and fortune! In the happy days to be,<br>
    Men of every clime and nation will be round to gaze on me --<br>
    Scientific men in thousands, men of mark and men of note,<br>
    Rushing down the Mooki River, after Johnson's antidote.<br>
    It will cure Delirium Tremens, when the patient's eyeballs stare<br>
    At imaginary spiders, snakes which really are not there.<br>
    When he thinks he sees them wriggle, when he thinks he sees them bloat,<br>
    It will cure him just to think of Johnson's Snakebite Antidote.'
  </p>

  <p>
    Then he rushed to the museum, found a scientific man --<br>
    `Trot me out a deadly serpent, just the deadliest you can;<br>
    I intend to let him bite me, all the risk I will endure,<br>
    Just to prove the sterling value of my wondrous snakebite cure.<br>
    Even though an adder bit me, back to life again I'd float;<br>
    Snakes are out of date, I tell you, since I've found the antidote.'
  </p>

  <p>
    Said the scientific person, `If you really want to die,<br>
    Go ahead -- but, if you're doubtful, let your sheep-dog have a try.<br>
    Get a pair of dogs and try it, let the snake give both a nip;<br>
    Give your dog the snakebite mixture, let the other fellow rip;<br>
    If he dies and yours survives him, then it proves the thing is good.<br>
    Will you fetch your dog and try it?' Johnson rather thought he would.<br>
    So he went and fetched his canine, hauled him forward by the throat.<br>
    `Stump, old man,' says he, `we'll show them we've the genwine antidote.'
  </p>

  <p>
    Both the dogs were duly loaded with the poison-gland's contents;<br>
    Johnson gave his dog the mixture, then sat down to wait events.<br>
    `Mark,' he said, `in twenty minutes Stump'll be a-rushing round,<br>
    While the other wretched creature lies a corpse upon the ground.'<br>
    But, alas for William Johnson! ere they'd watched a half-hour's spell<br>
    Stumpy was as dead as mutton, t'other dog was live and well.<br>
    And the scientific person hurried off with utmost speed,<br>
    Tested Johnson's drug and found it was a deadly poison-weed;<br>
    Half a tumbler killed an emu, half a spoonful killed a goat,<br>
    All the snakes on earth were harmless to that awful antidote.
  </p>

  <p>
    Down along the Mooki River, on the overlanders' camp,<br>
    Where the serpents are in millions, all of the most deadly stamp,<br>
    Wanders, daily, William Johnson, down among those poisonous hordes,<br>
    Shooting every stray goanna, calls them `black and yaller frauds'.<br>
    And King Billy, of the Mooki, cadging for the cast-off coat,<br>
    Somehow seems to dodge the subject of the snake-bite antidote.
