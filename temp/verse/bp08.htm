  <p>
    'Twas Mulga Bill, from Eaglehawk, that caught the cycling craze;<br>
    He turned away the good old horse that served him many days;<br>
    He dressed himself in cycling clothes, resplendent to be seen;<br>
    He hurried off to town and bought a shining new machine;<br>
    And as he wheeled it through the door, with air of lordly pride,<br>
    The grinning shop assistant said, "Excuse me, can you ride?"
  </p>

  <p>
    "See here, young man," said Mulga Bill, "from Walgett to the sea,<br>
    From Conroy's Gap to Castlereagh, there's none can ride like me.<br>
    I'm good all round at everything, as everybody knows,<br>
    Although I'm not the one to talk - I hate a man that blows.<br>
    But riding is my special gift, my chiefest, sole delight;<br>
    Just ask a wild duck can it swim, a wildcat can it fight.<br>
    There's nothing clothed in hair or hide, or built of flesh or steel,<br>
    There's nothing walks or jumps, or runs, on axle, hoof, or wheel,<br>
    But what I'll sit, while hide will hold and girths and straps are tight:<br>
    I'll ride this here two-wheeled concern right straight away at sight."
  </p>

  <p>
    'Twas Mulga Bill, from Eaglehawk, that sought his own abode,<br>
    That perched above the Dead Man's Creek, beside the mountain road.<br>
    He turned the cycle down the hill and mounted for the fray,<br>
    But ere he'd gone a dozen yards it bolted clean away.<br>
    It left the track, and through the trees, just like a silver streak,<br>
    It whistled down the awful slope towards the Dead Man's Creek.
  </p>

  <p>
    It shaved a stump by half an inch, it dodged a big white-box:<br>
    The very wallaroos in fright went scrambling up the rocks,<br>
    The wombats hiding in their caves dug deeper underground,<br>
    As Mulga Bill, as white as chalk, sat tight to every bound.<br>
    It struck a stone and gave a spring that cleared a fallen tree,<br>
    It raced beside a precipice as close as close could be;<br>
    And then as Mulga Bill let out one last despairing shriek <br>
    It made a leap of twenty feet into the Dead Man's Creek.
  </p>

  <p>
    'Twas Mulga Bill from Eaglehawk, that slowly swam ashore:<br>
    He said, "I've had some narrer shaves and lively rides before;<br>
    I've rode a wild bull round a yard to win a five-pound bet,<br>
    But this was the most awful ride that I've encountered yet.<br>
    I'll give that two-wheeled outlaw best; It's shaken all my nerve <br>
    To feel it whistle through the air and plunge and buck and swerve.<br>
    It's safe at rest in Dead Man's Creek, we'll leave it lying still;<br>
    A horse's back is good enough henceforth for Mulga Bill."
