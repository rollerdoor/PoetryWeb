<div class="verse">
  <p>
    The creek went down with a broken song,<br>
    'Neath the sheoaks high;<br>
    The waters carried the song along,<br>
    And the oaks a sigh.
  </p>

  <p>
    The song and the sigh went winding by,<br>
    Went winding down;<br>
    Circling the foot of the mountain high,<br>
    And the hillside brown.
  </p>

  <p>
    They were hushed in the swamp of the Dead Man's Crime,<br>
    Where the curlews cried;<br>
    But they reached the river the self-same time,<br>
    And there they died.
  </p>

  <p>
    And the creek of life goes winding on,<br>
    Wandering by;<br>
    And bears for ever, its course upon,<br>
    A song and a sigh.
  </p>
