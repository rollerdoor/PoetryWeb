  <p>
    Now McEvoy was altar-boy<br>
    As long as I remember;<br>
    He was, bedad, a crabbed lad,<br>
    And sixty come December. <br>
    Faith, no one dared to "interfare"<br>
    In things the which concernin' '<br>
    Twas right and just to him to trust<br>
    Who had the bit o' learnin'<br>
    To serve the priest; and here at least<br>
    He never proved defaulter;<br>
    So, wet or dry, you could rely<br>
    To find him on the Altar.
  </p>

  <p>
    The acolyte in surplice white<br>
    Some admiration rouses:<br>
    But McEvoy was altar-boy<br>
    In "Sund'y coat-'n-trouses." <br>
    And out he'd steer, the eye severe<br>
    The depths behind him plumbin', <br>
    In dread, I wot (he once was "cot"),<br>
    The priest might not be comin':<br>
    Then, stepping slow on heel and toe,<br>
    No more he'd fail or falter,<br>
    But set likewise with hands and eyes<br>
    He'd move about the Altar
  </p>

  <p>
    A master-stroke of other folk<br>
    Might start the opposition,<br>
    And some, mebbe, in jealousy<br>
    Redoubt their erudition;<br>
    But McEvoy was altar-boy<br>
    And, spite of all their chattin',<br>
    It "put the stuns" on lesser ones<br>
    To hear him run the Latin.<br>
    And faith, he knew the business through,<br>
    The rubrics and the psalter;<br>
    You never met his "aikals" yet<br>
    When servin' on the Altar.
  </p>
  <p>
    The priest, indeed, might take the lead<br>
    By right of Holy Orders,<br>
    But McEvoy was altar-boy,<br>
    And just upon the borders.<br>
    So sermons dry he'd signify<br>
    With puckered brows behoovin', <br>
    An', if you please, at homilies<br>
    He'd nod the head approvin';<br>
    And all the while a cute old smile<br>
    Picked out the chief defaulter; <br>
    Faith, wet or dry, the crabbed eye<br>
    Would "vet" you from the Altar.
