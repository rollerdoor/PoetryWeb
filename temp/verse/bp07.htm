    "He ought to be home," said the old man, "without there’s something amiss.<br>
    He only went to the Two-mile – he ought to be back by this.<br>
    He would ride the Reckless filly, he would have his wilful way;<br>
    And, here, he’s not back at sundown – and what will his mother say?<br>
    "He was always his mother’s idol, since ever his father died;<br>
    And there isn’t a horse on the station that he isn’t game to ride.<br>
    But that Reckless mare is vicious, and if once she gets away<br>
    He hasn’t got strength to hold her – and what will his mother say?"
  </p>

  <p>
    The old man walked to the sliprail, and peered up the dark’ning track,<br>
    And looked and longed for the rider that would never more come back;<br>
    And the mother came and clutched him, with sudden, spasmodic fright:<br>
    "What has become of my Willie? Why isn’t he home tonight?"
  </p>

  <p>
    Away in the gloomy ranges, at the foot of an ironbark,<br>
    The bonnie, winsome laddie was lying stiff and stark;<br>
    For the Reckless mare had smashed him against a leaning limb,<br>
    And his comely face was battered, and his merry eyes were dim.
  </p>

  <p>
    And the thoroughbred chestnut filly, the saddle beneath her flanks,<br>
    Was away like fire through the ranges to join the wild mob’s ranks;<br>
    And a broken-hearted woman and an old man worn and grey<br>
    Were searching all night in the ranges till the sunrise brought the day.
  </p>

  <p>
    And the mother kept feebly calling, with a hope that would not die,<br>
    "Willie! where are you, Willie?" But how can the dead reply;<br>
    And hope died out with the daylight, and the darkness brought despair,<br>
    God pity the stricken mother, and answer the widow’s prayer!
  </p>

  <p>
    Though far and wide they sought him, they found not where he fell;<br>
    For the ranges held him precious, and guarded their treasure well.<br>
    The wattle blooms above him, and the bluebells blow close by,<br>
    And the brown bees buzz the secret, and the wild birds sing reply.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the mother pined and faded, and cried, and took no rest,<br>
    And rode each day to the ranges on her hopeless, weary quest.<br>
    Seeking her loved one ever, she faded and pined away,<br>
    But with strength of her great affection she still sought every day.
  </p>

  <p>
    "I know that sooner or later I shall find my boy," she said.<br>
    But she came not home one evening, and they found her lying dead,<br>
    And stamped on the poor pale features, as the spirit homeward pass’d,<br>
    Was an angel smile of gladness – she had found the boy at last.
