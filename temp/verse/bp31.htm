    The sheep were shorn and the wool went down<br>
    At the time of our local racing:<br>
    And I'd earned a spell -- I was burnt and brown --<br>
    So I rolled my swag for a trip to town<br>
    And a look at the steeplechasing.
  </p>

  <p>
    'Twas rough and ready -- an uncleared course<br>
    As rough as the blacks had found it;<br>
    With barbed-wire fences, topped with gorse,<br>
    And a water-jump that would drown a horse,<br>
    And the steeple three times round it.
  </p>

  <p>
    There was never a fence the tracks to guard, --<br>
    Some straggling posts defined 'em:<br>
    And the day was hot, and the drinking hard,<br>
    Till none of the stewards could see a yard<br>
    Before nor yet behind 'em!
  </p>

  <p>
    But the bell was rung and the nags were out,<br>
    Excepting an old outsider<br>
    Whose trainer started an awful rout,<br>
    For his boy had gone on a drinking bout<br>
    And left him without a rider.
  </p>

  <p>
    `Is there not one man in the crowd,' he cried,<br>
    `In the whole of the crowd so clever,<br>
    Is there not one man that will take a ride<br>
    On the old white horse from the Northern side<br>
    That was bred on the Mooki River?'
  </p>

  <p>
    'Twas an old white horse that they called The Cow,<br>
    And a cow would look well beside him;<br>
    But I was pluckier then than now<br>
    (And I wanted excitement anyhow),<br>
    So at last I agreed to ride him.
  </p>

  <p>
    And the trainer said, `Well, he's dreadful slow,<br>
    And he hasn't a chance whatever;<br>
    But I'm stony broke, so it's time to show<br>
    A trick or two that the trainers know<br>
    Who train by the Mooki River.
  </p>

  <p>
    `The first time round at the further side,<br>
    With the trees and the scrub about you,<br>
    Just pull behind them and run out wide<br>
    And then dodge into the scrub and hide,<br>
    And let them go round without you.
  </p>

  <p>
    `At the third time round, for the final spin<br>
    With the pace, and the dust to blind 'em,<br>
    They'll never notice if you chip in<br>
    For the last half-mile -- you'll be sure to win,<br>
    And they'll think you raced behind 'em.
  </p>

  <p>
    `At the water-jump you may have to swim --<br>
    He hasn't a hope to clear it --<br>
    Unless he skims like the swallows skim<br>
    At full speed over, but not for him!<br>
    He'll never go next or near it.
  </p>

  <p>
    `But don't you worry -- just plunge across,<br>
    For he swims like a well-trained setter.<br>
    Then hide away in the scrub and gorse<br>
    The rest will be far ahead of course --<br>
    The further ahead the better.
  </p>

  <p>
    `You must rush the jumps in the last half-round<br>
    For fear that he might refuse 'em;<br>
    He'll try to baulk with you, I'll be bound,<br>
    Take whip and spurs on the mean old hound,<br>
    And don't be afraid to use 'em.
  </p>

  <p>
    `At the final round, when the field are slow<br>
    And you are quite fresh to meet 'em,<br>
    Sit down, and hustle him all you know<br>
    With the whip and spurs, and he'll have to go --<br>
    Remember, you've <span class="ital">got</span> to beat 'em!'
  </p>

  <p> <span class="center">. . . . .</span> </p>

  <p>
    The flag went down and we seemed to fly,<br>
    And we made the timbers shiver<br>
    Of the first big fence, as the stand flashed by,<br>
    And I caught the ring of the trainer's cry:<br>
    `Go on! For the Mooki River!'
  </p>

  <p>
    I jammed him in with a well-packed crush,<br>
    And recklessly -- out for slaughter --<br>
    Like a living wave over fence and brush<br>
    We swept and swung with a flying rush,<br>
    Till we came to the dreaded water.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ha, ha! I laugh at it now to think<br>
    Of the way I contrived to work it.<br>
    Shut in amongst them, before you'd wink,<br>
    He found himself on the water's brink,<br>
    With never a chance to shirk it!
  </p>

  <p>
    The thought of the horror he felt, beguiles<br>
    The heart of this grizzled rover!<br>
    He gave a snort you could hear for miles,<br>
    And a spring would have cleared the Channel Isles<br>
    And carried me safely over!
  </p>

  <p>
    Then we neared the scrub, and I pulled him back<br>
    In the shade where the gum-leaves quiver:<br>
    And I waited there in the shadows black<br>
    While the rest of the horses, round the track,<br>
    Went on like a rushing river!
  </p>

  <p>
    At the second round, as the field swept by,<br>
    I saw that the pace was telling;<br>
    But on they thundered, and by-and-bye<br>
    As they passed the stand I could hear the cry<br>
    Of the folk in the distance, yelling!
  </p>

  <p>
    Then the last time round! And the hoofbeats rang!<br>
    And I said, `Well, it's now or never!'<br>
    And out on the heels of the throng I sprang,<br>
    And the spurs bit deep and the whipcord sang<br>
    As I rode! For the Mooki River!
  </p>

  <p>
    We raced for home in a cloud of dust<br>
    And the curses rose in chorus.<br>
    'Twas flog, and hustle, and jump you must!<br>
    And The Cow ran well -- but to my disgust<br>
    There was one got home before us.
  </p>

  <p>
    'Twas a big black horse, that I had not seen<br>
    In the part of the race I'd ridden;<br>
    And his coat was cool and his rider clean,<br>
    And I thought that perhaps I had not been<br>
    The only one that had hidden.
  </p>

  <p> <span class="center">. . . . .</span> </p>

  <p>
    And the trainer came with a visage blue<br>
    With rage, when the race concluded:<br>
    Said he, `I thought you'd have pulled us through,<br>
    But the man on the black horse planted too,<br>
    <span class="ital">And nearer to home than you did!'</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    Alas to think that those times so gay<br>
    Have vanished and passed for ever!<br>
    You don't believe in the yarn you say?<br>
    Why, man! 'Twas a matter of every day<br>
    When we raced on the Mooki River!
  </p>
