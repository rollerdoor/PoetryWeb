  <p>
    Old Mate! In the gusty old weather,<br>
    When our hopes and our troubles were new,<br>
    In the years spent in wearing out leather,<br>
    I found you unselfish and true –<br>
    I have gathered these verses together<br>
    For the sake of our friendship and you.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may think for awhile, and with reason,<br>
    Though still with a kindly regret,<br>
    That I've left it full late in the season<br>
    To prove I remember you yet;<br>
    But you'll never judge me by their treason<br>
    Who profit by friends – and forget.
  </p>

  <p>
    I remember, Old Man, I remember –<br>
    The tracks that we followed are clear –<br>
    The jovial last nights of December,<br>
    The solemn first days of the year,<br>
    Long tramps through the clearings and timber,<br>
    Short partings on platform and pier.
  </p>

  <p>
    I can still feel the spirit that bore us,<br>
    And often the old stars will shine –<br>
    I remember the last spree in chorus<br>
    For the sake of that other Lang Syne,<br>
    When the tracks lay divided before us,<br>
    Your path through the future and mine.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through the frost-wind that cut like whip-lashes,<br>
    Through the ever-blind haze of the drought –<br>
    And in fancy at times by the flashes<br>
    Of light in the darkness of doubt –<br>
    I have followed the tent poles and ashes<br>
    Of camps that we moved further out.
  </p>

  <p>
    You will find in these pages a trace of<br>
    That side of our past which was bright,<br>
    And recognise sometimes the face of<br>
    A friend who has dropped out of sight –<br>
    I send them along in the place of<br>
    The letters I promised to write.
