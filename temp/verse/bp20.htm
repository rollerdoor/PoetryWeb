    The roving breezes come and go<br>
    On Kiley's Run,<br>
    The sleepy river murmurs low,<br>
    And far away one dimly sees<br>
    Beyond the stretch of forest trees --<br>
    Beyond the foothills dusk and dun --<br>
    The ranges sleeping in the sun<br>
    On Kiley's Run.

    'Tis many years since first I came<br>
    To Kiley's Run,<br>
    More years than I would care to name<br>
    Since I, a stripling, used to ride<br>
    For miles and miles at Kiley's side,<br>
    The while in stirring tones he told<br>
    The stories of the days of old<br>
    On Kiley's Run.
  </p>

  <p>
    I see the old bush homestead now<br>
    On Kiley's Run,<br>
    Just nestled down beneath the brow<br>
    Of one small ridge above the sweep<br>
    Of river-flat, where willows weep<br>
    And jasmine flowers and roses bloom,<br>
    The air was laden with perfume<br>
    On Kiley's Run.
  </p>

  <p>
    We lived the good old station life<br>
    On Kiley's Run,<br>
    With little thought of care or strife.<br>
    Old Kiley seldom used to roam,<br>
    He liked to make the Run his home,<br>
    The swagman never turned away<br>
    With empty hand at close of day<br>
    From Kiley's Run.
  </p>

  <p>
    We kept a racehorse now and then<br>
    On Kiley's Run,<br>
    And neighb'ring stations brought their men<br>
    To meetings where the sport was free,<br>
    And dainty ladies came to see<br>
    Their champions ride; with laugh and song<br>
    The old house rang the whole night long<br>
    On Kiley's Run.
  </p>

  <p>
    The station hands were friends I wot<br>
    On Kiley's Run,<br>
    A reckless, merry-hearted lot --<br>
    All splendid riders, and they knew<br>
    The `boss' was kindness through and through.<br>
    Old Kiley always stood their friend,<br>
    And so they served him to the end<br>
    On Kiley's Run.
  </p>

  <p>
    But droughts and losses came apace<br>
    To Kiley's Run,<br>
    Till ruin stared him in the face;<br>
    He toiled and toiled while lived the light,<br>
    He dreamed of overdrafts at night:<br>
    At length, because he could not pay,<br>
    His bankers took the stock away<br>
    From Kiley's Run.
  </p>

  <p>
    Old Kiley stood and saw them go<br>
    From Kiley's Run.<br>
    The well-bred cattle marching slow;<br>
    His stockmen, mates for many a day,<br>
    They wrung his hand and went away.<br>
    Too old to make another start,<br>
    Old Kiley died -- of broken heart,<br>
    On Kiley's Run.

    The owner lives in England now<br>
    Of Kiley's Run.<br>
    He knows a racehorse from a cow;<br>
    But that is all he knows of stock:<br>
    His chiefest care is how to dock<br>
    Expenses, and he sends from town<br>
    To cut the shearers' wages down<br>
    On Kiley's Run.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are no neighbours anywhere<br>
    Near Kiley's Run.<br>
    The hospitable homes are bare,<br>
    The gardens gone; for no pretence<br>
    Must hinder cutting down expense:<br>
    The homestead that we held so dear<br>
    Contains a half-paid overseer<br>
    On Kiley's Run.
  </p>

  <p>
    All life and sport and hope have died<br>
    On Kiley's Run.<br>
    No longer there the stockmen ride;<br>
    For sour-faced boundary riders creep<br>
    On mongrel horses after sheep,<br>
    Through ranges where, at racing speed,<br>
    Old Kiley used to `wheel the lead'<br>
    On Kiley's Run.
  </p>

  <p>
    There runs a lane for thirty miles<br>
    Through Kiley's Run.<br>
    On either side the herbage smiles,<br>
    But wretched trav'lling sheep must pass<br>
    Without a drink or blade of grass<br>
    Thro' that long lane of death and shame:<br>
    The weary drovers curse the name<br>
    Of Kiley's Run.
  </p>

  <p>
    The name itself is changed of late<br>
    Of Kiley's Run.<br>
    They call it `Chandos Park Estate'.<br>
    The lonely swagman through the dark<br>
    Must hump his swag past Chandos Park.<br>
    The name is English, don't you see,<br>
    The old name sweeter sounds to me<br>
    Of `Kiley's Run'.
  </p>

  <p>
    I cannot guess what fate will bring<br>
    To Kiley's Run --<br>
    For chances come and changes ring --<br>
    I scarcely think 'twill always be<br>
    Locked up to suit an absentee;<br>
    And if he lets it out in farms<br>
    His tenants soon will carry arms<br>
    On Kiley's Run.
