  <p>
    'My name?' (He was wizened and wrinkled and grey,<br>
    And poverty-painted and old;<br>
    His dirt-armoured head on his blanket he lay,<br>
    And this is the tale that he told:)
  </p>

  <p>
    'Well, boss' (and he straightened his back bent with years,<br>
    And his tangled hair waved in the breeze,<br>
    The wind whistled in through the caves of his ears<br>
    And- the splits of his pants at the knees.
  </p>

  <p>
    His bluey was coiled like a boarding-house duff,<br>
    And his billy-can stood at its side;<br>
    His jumper, worn through ' the original stuff<br>
    Was cobbled with moleskin and hide.)
  </p>

  <p>
    "My name' (and he drew forth a whip from the swag,<br>
    And shook out the knots from the strands<br>
    That yet were unplaited) 'is Tommy the Lag' '<br>
    Then carefully spat on his hands.
  </p>

  <p>
    The yarn seemed to hang, so I threw him a plug,<br>
    And his eye brightened up in a trice;<br>
    Beatitude played round the sundowner's mug,<br>
    And his jaws went to work like a vice.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tobacco juice trickled in drops from his chin<br>
    And fell on the hair of his breast,<br>
    It seemed to transport him from damper and sin<br>
    To a land of ineffable rest.
  </p>

  <p>
    I thought it quite likely he'd chew for a week,<br>
    As he plainly took time by the year;<br>
    When, listlessly hooking the plug from his cheek<br>
    And inserting the same in his ear,
  </p>

  <p>
    He motioned me near, with a jerk of his head,<br>
    To a seat at the foot of the tree '<br>
    A stringybark, all but a branch or two dead;<br>
    It was just such a ruin as he.
  </p>

  <p>
    I waited, expecting to hear from the "vag'.<br>
    Some old tale of our criminal scum;<br>
    But he just grunted out: 'Yes, I'm Tommy the Lag '<br>
    Can you lend me a bob for a rum?'
  </p>
