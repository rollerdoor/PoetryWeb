    The stranger came from Narromine and made his little joke; <br>
    "They say we folks in Narromine are narrow-minded folk. <br>
    But all the smartest men down here are puzzled to define<br>
    A kind of new phenomenon that came to Narromine.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Last summer up in Narromine 'twas gettin' rather warm - <br>
    Two hundred in the water-bag, and lookin' like a storm - <br>
    We all were in the private bar, the coolest place in town, <br>
    When out across the stretch of plain a cloud came rollin' down.
  </p>

  <p>
    "We don't respect the clouds up there, they fill us with disgust, <br>
    They mostly bring a Bogan shower - three raindrops and some dust; <br>
    But each man, simultaneous-like, to each man said, 'I think<br>
    That cloud suggests it's up to us to have another drink!'
  </p>

  <p>
    "There's clouds of rain and clouds of dust - we'd heard of them before,<br>
    And sometimes in the daily press we read of 'clouds of war':<br>
    But - if this ain't the gospel truth I hope that I may burst -<br>
    That cloud that came to Narromine was just a cloud of thirst.
  </p>

  <p>
    "It wasn't like a common cloud, 'twas more a sort of haze;<br>
    It settled down about the streets, and stopped for days and days; <br>
    And not a drop of dew could fall, and not a sunbeam shine <br>
    To pierce that dismal sort of mist that hung on Narromine.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Oh, Lord! we had a dreadful time beneath that cloud of thirst! <br>
    We all chucked up our daily work and went upon the burst. <br>
    The very blacks about the town, that used to cadge for grub, <br>
    They made an organized attack and tried to loot the pub.
  </p>

  <p>
    "We couldn't leave the private bar no matter how we tried; <br>
    Shearers and squatters, union men and blacklegs side by side <br>
    Were drinkin' there and dursn't move, for each was sure, he said, <br>
    Before he'd get a half a mile the thirst would strike him dead!
  </p>

  <p>
    "We drank until the drink gave out; we searched from room to room,<br>
    And round the pub, like drunken ghosts, went howling through the gloom.<br>
    The shearers found some kerosene and settled down again,<br>
    But all the squatter chaps and I, we staggered to the train.
  </p>

  <p>
    "And once outside the cloud of thirst we felt as right as pie, <br>
    But while we stopped about the town we had to drink or die. <br>
    I hear today it's safe enough; I'm going back to work<br>
    Because they say the cloud of thirst has shifted on to Bourke.
  </p>

  <p>
    "But when you see those clouds about - like this one over here - <br>
    All white and frothy at the top, just like a pint of beer,<br>
    It's time to go and have a drink, for if that cloud should burst<br>
    You'd find the drink would all be gone, for that's a cloud of thirst!"
  </p>

  <p>
    We stood the man from Narromine a pint of half-and-half;<br>
    He drank it off without a gasp in one tremendous quaff;<br>
    "I joined some friends last night," he said, "in what they called a spree;<br>
    But after Narromine 'twas just a holiday to me."
  </p>

  <p>
    And now beyond the Western Range, where sunset skies are red, <br>
    And clouds of dust, and clouds of thirst, go drifting overhead, <br>
    The railway-train is taking back, along the Western Line, <br>
    That narrow-minded person on his road to Narromine.
