  <p>
    When the heavy sand is yielding backward from your blistered feet,<br>
    And across the distant timber you can SEE the flowing heat;<br>
    When your head is hot and aching, and the shadeless plain is wide,<br>
    And it's fifteen miles to water in the scrub the other side --<br>
    Don't give up, don't be down-hearted, to a man's strong heart be true!<br>
    Take the air in through your nostrils, set your lips and see it through --<br>
    For it can't go on for ever, and -- `I'll have my day!' says you.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you're camping in the mulga, and the
    rain is falling slow,<br>
    While you nurse your rheumatism 'neath a patch of calico;<br>
    Short of tucker or tobacco, short of sugar or of tea,<br>
    And the scrubs are dark and dismal, and the plains are like a sea;<br>
    Don't give up and be down-hearted -- to the soul of man be true!<br>
    Grin! if you've a mate to grin for, grin and jest and don't look blue;<br>
    For it can't go on for ever, and -- `I'll rise some day,' says you.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you've tramped the Sydney pavements till you've counted all the flags,<br>
    And your flapping boot-soles trip you, and your clothes are mostly rags,<br>
    When you're called a city loafer, shunned, abused, moved on, despised --<br>
    Fifty hungry beggars after every job that's advertised --<br>
    Don't be beaten! Hold your head up! To your wretched self be true;<br>
    Set your pride to fight your hunger! Be a MAN in all you do!<br>
    For it cannot last for ever -- `I will rise again!' says you.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you're dossing out in winter, in the darkness and the rain,<br>
    Crouching, cramped, and cold and hungry 'neath a seat in The Domain,<br>
    And a cloaked policeman stirs you with that mighty foot of his --<br>
    `Phwat d'ye mane? Phwat's this?<br>
    Who are ye? Come, move on -- git out av this!'<br>
    Don't get mad; 'twere only foolish; there is nought that you can do,<br>
    Save to mark his beat and time him -- find another hole or two;<br>
    But it can't go on for ever -- `I'll have money yet!' says you.
  </p>

  <p>*****</p>

  <p>
    Bother not about the morrow, for sufficient to the day<br>
    Is the evil (rather more so). Put your trust in God and pray!<br>
    Study well the ant, thou sluggard. Blessed are the meek and low.<br>
    Ponder calmly on the lilies -- how they idle, how they grow.<br>
    A man's a man! Obey your masters! Do not blame the proud and fat,<br>
    For the poor are always with them, and they cannot alter that.<br>
    Lay your treasures up in Heaven -- cling to life and see it through!<br>
    For it cannot last for ever -- `I shall die some day,' says you.
