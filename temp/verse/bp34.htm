     <p>
          Now this was what Macpherson told<br>
          While waiting in the stand;<br>
          A reckless rider, over-bold,<br>
          The only man with hands to hold<br>
          The rushing Rio Grande.
     </p>

     <p>
          He said, `This day I bid good-bye<br>
          To bit and bridle rein,<br>
          To ditches deep and fences high,<br>
          For I have dreamed a dream, and I<br>
          Shall never ride again.
     </p>

     <p>
          `I dreamt last night I rode this race<br>
          That I to-day must ride,<br>
          And cant'ring down to take my place<br>
          I saw full many an old friend's face<br>
          Come stealing to my side.
     </p>

     <p>
          `Dead men on horses long since dead,<br>
          They clustered on the track;<br>
          The champions of the days long fled,<br>
          They moved around with noiseless tread -<br>
          Bay, chestnut, brown, and black.
     </p>

     <p>
          `And one man on a big grey steed<br>
          Rode up and waved his hand;<br>
          Said he, "We help a friend in need,<br>
          And we have come to give a lead<br>
          To you and Rio Grande.
     </p>

     <p>
          `"For you must give the field the slip,<br>
          So never draw the rein,<br>
          But keep him moving with the whip,<br>
          And if he falter - set your lip<br>
          And rouse him up again.
     </p>

     <p>
          `"But when you reach the big stone wall,<br>
          Put down your bridle hand<br>
          And let him sail - he cannot fall -<br>
          But don't you interfere at all;<br>
          You trust old Rio Grande."
     </p>

     <p>
          `We started, and in front we showed,<br>
          The big horse running free:<br>
          Right fearlessly and game he strode,<br>
          And by my side those dead men rode<br>
          Whom no one else could see.
     </p>

     <p>
          `As silently as flies a bird,<br>
          They rode on either hand;<br>
          At every fence I plainly heard<br>
          The phantom leader give the word,<br>
          "Make room for Rio Grande!"
     </p>

     <p>
          `I spurred him on to get the lead,<br>
          I chanced full many a fall;<br>
          But swifter still each phantom steed<br>
          Kept with me, and at racing speed<br>
          We reached the big stone wall.
     </p>

     <p>
          `And there the phantoms on each side<br>
          Drew in and blocked his leap;<br>
          "Make room! make room!" I loudly cried,<br>
          But right in front they seemed to ride -<br>
          I cursed them in my sleep.
     </p>

     <p>
          `He never flinched, he faced it game,<br>
          He struck it with his chest,<br>
          And every stone burst out in flame,<br>
          And Rio Grande and I became<br>
          As phantoms with the rest.
     </p>

     <p>
          `And then I woke, and for a space<br>
          All nerveless did I seem;<br>
          For I have ridden many a race,<br>
          But never one at such a pace<br>
          As in that fearful dream.
     </p>

     <p>
          `And I am sure as man can be<br>
          That out upon the track,<br>
          Those phantoms that men cannot see<br>
          Are waiting now to ride with me,<br>
          And I shall not come back.
     </p>

     <p>
          `For I must ride the dead men's race,<br>
          And follow their command;<br>
          'Twere worse than death, the foul disgrace<br>
          If I should fear to take my place<br>
          To-day on Rio Grande.'
     </p>

     <p>
          He mounted, and a jest he threw,<br>
          With never sign of gloom;<br>
          But all who heard the story knew<br>
          That Jack Macpherson, brave and true,<br>
          Was going to his doom.
     </p>

     <p>
          They started, and the big black steed<br>
          Came flashing past the stand;<br>
          All single-handed in the lead<br>
          He strode along at racing speed,<br>
          The mighty Rio Grande.
     </p>

     <p>
          But on his ribs the whalebone stung,<br>
          A madness it did seem!<br>
          And soon it rose on every tongue<br>
          That Jack Macpherson rode among<br>
          The creatures of his dream.
     </p>

     <p>
          He looked to left and looked to right,<br>
          As though men rode beside;<br>
          And Rio Grande, with foam-flecks white,<br>
          Raced at his jumps in headlong flight<br>
          And cleared them in his stride.
     </p>

     <p>
          But when they reached the big stone wall,<br>
          Down went the bridle-hand,<br>
          And loud we heard Macpherson call,<br>
          `Make room, or half the field will fall!<br>
          Make room for Rio Grande!'
     </p>

     <p> <span class="center">. . . . .</span> </p>

     <p>
          `He's down! he's down!' And horse and man<br>
          Lay quiet side by side!<br>
          No need the pallid face to scan,<br>
          We knew with Rio Grande he ran<br>
          The race the dead men ride.
