  <p>
    When I was up the country in the rough and early days,<br>
    I used to work along ov Jimmy Nowlett's bullick-drays;<br>
    Then the reelroad wasn't heered on, an' the bush was wild an' strange,<br>
    An' we useter draw the timber from the saw-pits in the range ~<br>
    Load provisions for the stations, an' we'd travel far and slow<br>
    Through the plains an' 'cross the ranges in the days of long ago.
  </p>

  <p><span class="ital">
      Then it's yoke up the bullicks and
      tramp beside 'em slow,<br>
      An' saddle up yer horses an' a-ridin' we will go,<br>
      To the bullick-drivin', cattle-drovin',<br>
      Nigger, digger, roarin', rovin'<br>
      Days o' long ago.

  </p>

  <p>
    Once me and Jimmy Nowlett loaded timber for the town,<br>
    But we hadn't gone a dozen mile before the rain come down,<br>
    An' me an' Jimmy Nowlett an' the bullicks an' the dray<br>
    Was cut off on some risin' ground while floods around us lay;<br>
    An' we soon run short of tucker an' terbaccer, which was bad,<br>
    An' pertaters dipped in honey was the only tuck we had.
  </p>

  <p>
    An' half our bullicks perished when the drought was on the land,<br>
    An' the burnin' heat that dazzles as it dances on the sand;<br>
    When the sun-baked clay an' gravel paves for miles the burnin' creeks,<br>
    An' at ev'ry step yer travel there a rottin' carcase reeks -<br>
    But we pulled ourselves together, for we never used ter know<br>
    What a feather bed was good for in those days o' long ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    But in spite ov barren ridges an' in spite ov mud an' heat, <br>
    An' the dust that browned the bushes when it rose from bullicks' feet,<br>
    An' in spite ov cold and chilblains when the bush was white with frost,<br>
    An' in spite of muddy water where the burnin' plain was crossed,<br>
    An' in spite of modern progress, and in spite of all their blow,<br>
    Twas a better land to live in, in the days o' long ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the frosty moon was shinin' o'er the ranges like a lamp, <br>
    An' a lot of bullick-drivers was a-campin' on the camp. <br>
    When the fire was blazin' cheery an' the pipes was drawin' well,<br>
    Then our songs we useter chorus an' our yarns we useter tell,<br>
    An' we'd talk ov lands we come from, and ov chaps we useter know<br>
    For there always was behind us other days o' long ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ah, them early days was ended when the reelroad crossed the plain, <br>
    But in dreams I often tramp beside the bullick-team again: <br>
    Still we pauses at the shanty just to have a drop er cheer, <br>
    Still I feels a kind ov pleasure when the campin'-ground is near;<br>
    Still I smells the old tarpaulin me an' Jimmy useter throw <br>
    'Cross the timber-truck for shelter in the days ov long ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have been a-driftin' back'ards with the changes ov the land, <br>
    An' if I spoke ter bullicks now they wouldn't understand, <br>
    But when Mary wakes me sudden in the night, I'll often say: <br>
    'Come here, Spot, an' stan' up, Bally, blank an' blank an' come-eer-way.' <br>
    An' she says that, when I'm sleepin', oft my elerquince 'ill flow<br>
    In the bullick-drivin' language ov the days o' long ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    Well, the pub will soon be closin', so I'll give the thing a rest;<br>
    But if you should drop on Nowlett in the far an' distant west -<br>
    An' if Jimmy uses doubleyou instead of ar an' vee,<br>
    An' if he drops his aitches, then you're sure to know it's he.<br>
    An' yer won't forgit to arsk him if he still remembers Joe<br>
    As knowed him up the country in the days o' long ago.
