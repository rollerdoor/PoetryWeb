  <p>
    The embers were blinking and clinking away,<br>
    The casement half open was thrown;<br>
    There was nothing but cloud on the skirts of the Day,<br>
    And I sat on the threshold alone!
  </p>

  <p>
    And said to the river which flowed by my door<br>
    With its beautiful face to the hill,<br>
    "I have waited and waited, all wearied and sore,<br>
    But my love is a wanderer still!"
  </p>

  <p>
    And said to the wind, as it paused in its flight<br>
    To look through the shivering pane,<br>
    "There are memories moaning and homeless to-night<br>
    That can never be tranquil again!"
  </p>

  <p>
    And said to the woods, as their burdens were borne<br>
    With a flutter and sigh to the eaves,<br>
    "They are wrinkled and wasted, and tattered and torn,<br>
    And we too have our withering leaves."
  </p>

  <p>
    Did I hear a low echo of footfalls about,<br>
    Whilst watching those forest trees stark?<br>
    Or was it a dream that I hurried without<br>
    To clutch at and grapple the dark?
  </p>

  <p>
    In the shadow I stood for a moment and spake —<br>
    "Bright thing that was loved in the past,<br>
    Oh! am I asleep — or abroad and awake?<br>
    And are you so near me at last?
  </p>

  <p>
    "Oh, roamer from lands where the vanished years go,<br>
    Oh, waif from those mystical zones,<br>
    Come here where I long for you, broken and low,<br>
    On the mosses and watery stones!
  </p>

  <p>
    "Come out of your silence and tell me if Life<br>
    Is so fair in that world as they say;<br>
    Was it worth all this yearning, and weeping, and strife<br>
    When you left it behind you to-day?
  </p>

  <p>
    "Will it end all this watching, and doubting, and dread?<br>
    Do these sorrows die out with our breath?<br>
    Will they pass from our souls like a nightmare," I said,<br>
    "While we glide through the mazes of Death?
  </p>

  <p>
    "Come out of that darkness and teach me the lore<br>
    You have learned since I looked on your face;<br>
    By the summers that blossomed and faded of yore —<br>
    By the lights which have fled to that place!
  </p>

  <p>
    "You answer me not when I know that you could —<br>
    When I know that you could and you should;<br>
    Though the storms be abroad on the wave;<br>
    Though the rain droppeth down with a wail to the wood,<br>
    And my heart is as cold as your grave!"
  </p>
