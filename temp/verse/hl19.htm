  <p>
    There are scenes in the distance where beauty is not,<br>
    On the desolate flats where gaunt appletrees rot.<br>
    Where the brooding old ridge rises up to the breeze<br>
    From his dark lonely gullies of stringy-bark trees,<br>
    There are voice-haunted gaps, ever sullen and strange,<br>
    But Eurunderee lies like a gem in the range.
  </p>

  <p>
    Still I see in my fancy the dark-green and blue<br>
    Of the box-covered hills where the five-corners grew;<br>
    And the rugged old sheoaks that sighed in the bend<br>
    O'er the lily-decked pools where the dark ridges end,<br>
    And the scrub-covered spurs running down from the Peak<br>
    To the deep grassy banks of Eurunderee Creek.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the knolls where the vineyards and fruit-gardens are<br>
    There's a beauty that even the drought cannot mar;<br>
    For I noticed it oft, in the days that are lost,<br>
    As I trod on the siding where lingered the frost,<br>
    When the shadows of night from the gullies were gone<br>
    And the hills in the background were flushed by the dawn.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was there in late years, but there's many a change<br>
    Where the Cudgegong River flows down through the range,<br>
    For the curse of the town with the railroad had come,<br>
    And the goldfields were dead. And the girl and the chum<br>
    And the old home were gone, yet the oaks seemed to speak<br>
    Of the hazy old days on Eurunderee Creek.
  </p>

  <p>
    And I stood by that creek, ere the sunset grew cold,<br>
    When the leaves of the sheoaks are traced on the gold,<br>
    And I thought of old things, and I thought of old folks,<br>
    Till I sighed in my heart to the sigh of the oaks;<br>
    For the years waste away like the waters that leak<br>
    Through the pebbles and sand of Eurunderee Creek.
