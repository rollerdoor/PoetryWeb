    Hold hard, Ned! Lift me down once more, and lay me in the shade.<br>
    Old man, you've had your work cut out to guide<br>
    Both horses, and to hold me in the saddle when I swayed,<br>
    All through the hot, slow, sleepy, silent ride.<br>
    The dawn at "Moorabinda" was a mist rack dull and dense,<br>
    The sun-rise was a sullen, sluggish lamp;<br>
    I was dozing in the gateway at Arbuthnot's bound'ry fence,<br>
    I was dreaming on the Limestone cattle camp.<br>
    We crossed the creek at Carricksford, and sharply through the haze,<br>
    And suddenly the sun shot flaming forth;<br>
    To southward lay "Katawa", with the sand peaks all ablaze,<br>
    And the flushed fields of Glen Lomond lay to north.<br>
    Now westward winds the bridle-path that leads to Lindisfarm,<br>
    And yonder looms the double-headed Bluff;<br>
    From the far side of the first hill, when the skies are clear and calm,<br>
    You can see Sylvester's woolshed fair enough.<br>
    Five miles we used to call it from our homestead to the place<br>
    Where the big tree spans the roadway like an arch;<br>
    'Twas here we ran the dingo down that gave us such a chase<br>
    Eight years ago — or was it nine? — last March.
  </p>

  <p>
    'Twas merry in the glowing morn among the gleaming grass,<br>
    To wander as we've wandered many a mile,<br>
    And blow the cool tobacco cloud, and watch the white wreaths pass,<br>
    Sitting loosely in the saddle all the while.<br>
    'Twas merry 'mid the blackwoods, when we spied the station roofs,<br>
    To wheel the wild scrub cattle at the yard,<br>
    With a running fire of stock whips and a fiery run of hoofs;<br>
    Oh! the hardest day was never then too hard!
  </p>

  <p>
    Aye! we had a glorious gallop after "Starlight" and his gang,<br>
    When they bolted from Sylvester's on the flat;<br>
    How the sun-dried reed-beds crackled, how the flint-strewn ranges rang,<br>
    To the strokes of "Mountaineer" and "Acrobat".<br>
    Hard behind them in the timber, harder still across the heath,<br>
    Close beside them through the tea-tree scrub we dash'd;<br>
    And the golden-tinted fern leaves, how they rustled underneath;<br>
    And the honeysuckle osiers, how they crash'd!
  </p>

  <p>
    We led the hunt throughout, Ned, on the chestnut and the grey,<br>
    And the troopers were three hundred yards behind,<br>
    While we emptied our six-shooters on the bushrangers at bay,<br>
    In the creek with stunted box-trees for a blind!<br>
    There you grappled with the leader, man to man, and horse to horse,<br>
    And you roll'd together when the chestnut rear'd;<br>
    He blazed away and missed you in that shallow water-course —<br>
    A narrow shave — his powder singed your beard!
  </p>

  <p>
    In these hours when life is ebbing, how those days when life was young<br>
    Come back to us; how clearly I recall<br>
    Even the yarns Jack Hall invented, and the songs Jem Roper sung;<br>
    And where are now Jem Roper and Jack Hall?
  </p>

  <p>
    Ay! nearly all our comrades of the old colonial school,<br>
    Our ancient boon companions, Ned, are gone;<br>
    Hard livers for the most part, somewhat reckless as a rule,<br>
    It seems that you and I are left alone.
  </p>

  <p>
    There was Hughes, who got in trouble through that business with the cards,<br>
    It matters little what became of him;<br>
    But a steer ripp'd up Macpherson in the Cooraminta yards,<br>
    And Sullivan was drown'd at Sink-or-swim;<br>
    And Mostyn — poor Frank Mostyn — died at last, a fearful wreck,<br>
    In the "horrors" at the Upper Wandinong,<br>
    And Carisbrooke, the rider, at the Horsefall broke his neck;<br>
    Faith! the wonder was he saved his neck so long!
  </p>

  <p>
    Ah! those days and nights we squandered at the Logans' in the glen —<br>
    The Logans, man and wife, have long been dead.<br>
    Elsie's tallest girl seems taller than your little Elsie then;<br>
    And Ethel is a woman grown and wed.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've had my share of pastime, and I've done my share of toil,<br>
    And life is short — the longest life a span;<br>
    I care not now to tarry for the corn or for the oil,<br>
    Or for wine that maketh glad the heart of man.<br>
    For good undone, and gifts misspent, and resolutions vain,<br>
    'Tis somewhat late to trouble. This I know —<br>
    I should live the same life over, if I had to live again;<br>
    And the chances are I go where most men go.
  </p>

  <p>
    The deep blue skies wax dusky, and the tall green trees grow dim,<br>
    The sward beneath me seems to heave and fall;<br>
    And sickly, smoky shadows through the sleepy sunlight swim,<br>
    And on the very sun's face weave their pall.<br>
    Let me slumber in the hollow where the wattle blossoms wave,<br>
    With never stone or rail to fence my bed;<br>
    Should the sturdy station children pull the bush-flowers on my grave,<br>
    I may chance to hear them romping overhead.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don't suppose I shall though, for I feel like sleeping sound,<br>
    That sleep, they say, is doubtful. True; but yet<br>
    At least it makes no difference to the dead man underground<br>
    What the living men remember or forget.<br>
    Enigmas that perplex us in the world's unequal strife,<br>
    The future may ignore or may reveal;<br>
    Yet some, as weak as water, Ned, to make the best of life,<br>
    Have been to face the worst as true as steel.
