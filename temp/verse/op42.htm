    Time that is moved by little fidget wheels<br>
    Is not my time, the flood that does not flow.<br>
    Between the double and the single bell<br>
    Of a ship's hour, between a round of bells<br>
    From the dark warship riding there below,<br>
    I have lived many lives, and this one life<br>
    Of Joe, long dead, who lives between five bells.
  </p>

  <p>
    Deep and dissolving verticals of light<br>
    Ferry the falls of moonshine down. Five bells<br>
    Coldly rung out in a machine's voice. Night and water<br>
    Pour to one rip of darkness, the Harbour floats<br>
    In the air, the Cross hangs upside-down in water.
  </p>

  <p>
    Why do I think of you, dead man, why thieve<br>
    These profitless lodgings from the flukes of thought<br>
    Anchored in Time? You have gone from earth,<br>
    Gone even from the meaning of a name;<br>
    Yet something's there, yet something forms its lips<br>
    And hits and cries against the ports of space,<br>
    Beating their sides to make its fury heard.
  </p>

  <p>
    Are you shouting at me, dead man, squeezing your face<br>
    In agonies of speech on speechless panes?<br>
    Cry louder, beat the windows, bawl your name!
  </p>

  <p>
    But I hear nothing, nothing...only bells,<br>
    Five bells, the bumpkin calculus of Time.<br>
    Your echoes die, your voice is dowsed by Life,<br>
    There's not a mouth can fly the pygmy strait -<br>
    Nothing except the memory of some bones<br>
    Long shoved away, and sucked away, in mud;<br>
    And unimportant things you might have done,<br>
    Or once I thought you did; but you forgot,<br>
    And all have now forgotten - looks and words<br>
    And slops of beer; your coat with buttons off,<br>
    Your gaunt chin and pricked eye, and raging tales<br>
    Of Irish kings and English perfidy,<br>
    And dirtier perfidy of publicans<br>
    Groaning to God from Darlinghurst.<br>
    Five bells.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then I saw the road, I heard the thunder<br>
    Tumble, and felt the talons of the rain<br>
    The night we came to Moorebank in slab-dark,<br>
    So dark you bore no body, had no face,<br>
    But a sheer voice that rattled out of air<br>
    (As now you'd cry if I could break the glass),<br>
    A voice that spoke beside me in the bush,<br>
    Loud for a breath or bitten off by wind,<br>
    Of Milton, melons, and the Rights of Man,<br>
    And blowing flutes, and how Tahitian girls<br>
    Are brown and angry-tongued, and Sydney girls<br>
    Are white and angry-tongued, or so you'd found.<br>
    But all I heard was words that didn't join<br>
    So Milton became melons, melons girls,<br>
    And fifty mouths, it seemed, were out that night,<br>
    And in each tree an Ear was bending down,<br>
    Or something that had just run, gone behind the grass,<br>
    When blank and bone-white, like a maniac's thought,<br>
    The naphtha-flash of lightning slit the sky,<br>
    Knifing the dark with deathly photographs.<br>
    There's not so many with so poor a purse<br>
    Or fierce a need, must fare by night like that,<br>
    Five miles in darkness on a country track,<br>
    But when you do, that's what you think.<br>
    Five bells.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Melbourne, your appetite had gone,<br>
    Your angers too; they had been leeched away<br>
    By the soft archery of summer rains<br>
    And the sponge-paws of wetness, the slow damp<br>
    That stuck the leaves of living, snailed the mind,<br>
    And showed your bones, that had been sharp with rage,<br>
    The sodden ectasies of rectitude.<br>
    I thought of what you'd written in faint ink,<br>
    Your journal with the sawn-off lock, that stayed behind<br>
    With other things you left, all without use,<br>
    All without meaning now, except a sign<br>
    That someone had been living who now was dead:<br>
    "At Labassa. Room 6 x 8<br>
    On top of the tower; because of this, very dark<br>
    And cold in winter. Everything has been stowed<br>
    Into this room - 500 books all shapes<br>
    And colours, dealt across the floor<br>
    And over sills and on the laps of chairs;<br>
    Guns, photoes of many differant things<br>
    And differant curioes that I obtained..."
  </p>

  <p>
    In Sydney, by the spent aquarium-flare<br>
    Of penny gaslight on pink wallpaper,<br>
    We argued about blowing up the world,<br>
    But you were living backward, so each night<br>
    You crept a moment closer to the breast,<br>
    And they were living, all of them, those frames<br>
    And shapes of flesh that had perplexed your youth,<br>
    And most your father, the old man gone blind,<br>
    With fingers always round a fiddle's neck,<br>
    That graveyard mason whose fair monuments<br>
    And tablets cut with dreams of piety<br>
    Rest on the bosoms of a thousand men<br>
    Staked bone by bone, in quiet astonishment<br>
    At cargoes they had never thought to bear,<br>
    These funeral-cakes of sweet and sculptured stone.
  </p>

  <p>
    Where have you gone? The tide is over you,<br>
    The turn of midnight water's over you,<br>
    As Time is over you, and mystery,<br>
    And memory, the flood that does not flow.<br>
    You have no suburb, like those easier dead<br>
    In private berths of dissolution laid -<br>
    The tide goes over, the waves ride over you<br>
    And let their shadows down like shining hair,<br>
    But they are Water; and the sea-pinks bend<br>
    Like lilies in your teeth, but they are Weed;<br>
    And you are only part of an Idea.<br>
    I felt the wet push its black thumb-balls in,<br>
    The night you died, I felt your eardrums crack,<br>
    And the short agony, the longer dream,<br>
    The Nothing that was neither long nor short;<br>
    But I was bound, and could not go that way,<br>
    But I was blind, and could not feel your hand.<br>
    If I could find an answer, could only find<br>
    Your meaning, or could say why you were here<br>
    Who now are gone, what purpose gave you breath<br>
    Or seized it back, might I not hear your voice?
  </p>

  <p>
    I looked out my window in the dark<br>
    At waves with diamond quills and combs of light<br>
    That arched their mackerel-backs and smacked the sand<br>
    In the moon's drench, that straight enormous glaze,<br>
    And ships far off asleep, and Harbour-buoys<br>
    Tossing their fireballs wearily each to each,<br>
    And tried to hear your voice, but all I heard<br>
    Was a boat's whistle, and the scraping squeal<br>
    Of seabirds' voices far away, and bells,<br>
    Five bells. Five bells coldly ringing out.<br>
    Five bells.
