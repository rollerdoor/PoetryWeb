  <p>
    Beyond the land where Leichhardt went,<br>
    Beyond Sturt's Western track,<br>
    The rolling tide of change has sent<br>
    Some strange J.P.s out back.
  </p>

  <p>
    And Saltbush Bill, grown old and grey,<br>
    And worn with want of sleep,<br>
    Received the news in camp one day<br>
    Behind the travelling sheep
  </p>

  <p>
    That Edward Rex, confiding in<br>
    His known integrity,<br>
    By hand and seal on parchment skin<br>
    Had made him a J.P.
  </p>

  <p>
    He read the news with eager face<br>
    But found no word of pay.<br>
    "I'd like to see my sister's place<br>
    And kids on Christmas day.
  </p>

  <p>
    "I'd like to see green grass again,<br>
    And watch clear water run,<br>
    Away from this unholy plain,<br>
    And flies, and dust, and sun."
  </p>

  <p>
    At last one little clause he found<br>
    That might some hope inspire,<br>
    "A magistrate may charge a pound<br>
    For inquest on a fire."
  </p>

  <p>
    A big blacks' camp was built close by,<br>
    And Saltbush Bill, says he,<br>
    "I think that camp might well supply<br>
    A job for a J.P."
  </p>

  <p>
    That night, by strange coincidence,<br>
    A most disastrous fire<br>
    Destroyed the country residence<br>
    Of Jacky Jack, Esquire.
  </p>

  <p>
    'Twas mostly leaves, and bark, and dirt;<br>
    The party most concerned<br>
    Appeared to think it wouldn't hurt<br>
    If forty such were burned.
  </p>

  <p>
    Quite otherwise thought Saltbush Bill,<br>
    Who watched the leaping flame.<br>
    "The home is small," said he, "but still<br>
    The principle's the same.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Midst palaces though you should roam,<br>
    Or follow pleasure's tracks,<br>
    You'll find," he said, "no place like home,<br>
    At least like Jacky Jack's.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Tell every man in camp `Come quick,'<br>
    Tell every black Maria<br>
    I give tobacco half a stick --<br>
    Hold inquest long-a fire."
  </p>

  <p>
    Each juryman received a name<br>
    Well suited to a Court.<br>
    "Long Jack" and "Stumpy Bill" became<br>
    "John Long" and "William Short".
  </p>

  <p>
    While such as "Tarpot", "Bullock Dray",<br>
    And "Tommy Wait-a-While",<br>
    Became, for ever and a day,<br>
    "Scott", "Dickens", and "Carlyle".
  </p>

  <p>
    And twelve good sable men and true<br>
    Were soon engaged upon<br>
    The conflagration that o'erthrew<br>
    The home of John A. John.
  </p>

  <p>
    Their verdict, "Burnt by act of Fate",<br>
    They scarcely had returned<br>
    When, just behind the magistrate,<br>
    Another humpy burned!
  </p>

  <p>
    The jury sat again and drew<br>
    Another stick of plug.<br>
    Said Saltbush Bill, "It's up to you<br>
    Put some one long-a Jug."
  </p>

  <p>
    "I'll camp the sheep," he said, "and sift<br>
    The evidence about."<br>
    For quite a week he couldn't shift,<br>
    The way the fires broke out.
  </p>

  <p>
    The jury thought the whole concern<br>
    As good as any play.<br>
    They used to "take him oath" and earn<br>
    Three sticks of plug a day.
  </p>

  <p>
    At last the tribe lay down to sleep<br>
    Homeless, beneath a tree;<br>
    And onward with his travelling sheep<br>
    Went Saltbush Bill, J.P.
  </p>

  <p>
    The sheep delivered, safe and sound,<br>
    His horse to town he turned,<br>
    And drew some five-and-twenty pound<br>
    For fees that he had earned.
  </p>

  <p>
    And where Monaro's ranges hide<br>
    Their little farms away --<br>
    His sister's children by his side --<br>
    He spent his Christmas Day.
  </p>

  <p>
    The next J.P. that went out back<br>
    Was shocked, or pained, or both,<br>
    At hearing every pagan black<br>
    Repeat the juror's oath.
  </p>

  <p>
    No matter though he turned and fled<br>
    They followed faster still;<br>
    "You make it inkwich, boss," they said,<br>
    "All same like Saltbush Bill."
  </p>

  <p>
    They even said they'd let him see<br>
    The fires originate.<br>
    When he refused they said that he<br>
    Was "No good magistrate."
  </p>

  <p>
    And out beyond Sturt's Western track,<br>
    And Leichhardt's farthest tree,<br>
    They wait till fate shall send them back<br>
    Their Saltbush Bill, J.P.
