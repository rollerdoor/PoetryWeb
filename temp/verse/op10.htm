  <p>
    We were drinking beer in a quiet Pub<br>
    in a little old town out west.<br>
    We had told some yarns and bragged a bit,<br>
    and were giving our tongues a rest.
  </p>

  <p>
    There was me and Jim, and his brother Tom,<br>
    and a couple of shearer blokes,<br>
    for once in our lives all stricken dumb -<br>
    we had clean run out of jokes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now the silence was disturbing -<br>
    our beer was going flat,<br>
    there was nothing on the Telly,<br>
    and Jim just fiddled with his hat.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then a squeak from the hinge of the old bat-wings<br>
    turned all eyes towards the door,<br>
    and lo and behold, a weary flea<br>
    came hopping across the floor.
  </p>

  <p>
    He hopped across the dusty boards,<br>
    and jumped up on the bar,<br>
    and ordered seven schooners,<br>
    said, 'I'm dry, I've travelled far.'
  </p>

  <p>
    He gulped them down without a breath,<br>
    those schooners, one by one,<br>
    then told the boss to 'fill 'em up!<br>
    it's nearly time to run.'
  </p>

  <p>
    He downed those seven schooners<br>
    just as easily as the first,<br>
    then bought a dozen stubbies,<br>
    'just in case he got a thirst'.
  </p>

  <p>
    He paid his debt, picked up his load,<br>
    and skipped off down the bar,<br>
    and soared out over the bat-wing doors<br>
    and out past Tommy's car.
  </p>

  <p>
    Well, I looked at Jim, who stared at me,<br>
    and we gawked at the shearers too.<br>
    All blinked at the Boss, who shrugged at us,<br>
    and we wondered was it true.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then we heard an awful crash,<br>
    and the shattering of glass.<br>
    Said Jim, "I think I've had enough<br>
    I'll make that one me last"!
  </p>

  <p>
    The bat-wing hinges creaked again<br>
    as the flea came through the door,<br>
    with a busted wing, an injured leg,<br>
    and a lump beneath his jaw.
  </p>

  <p>
    He looked at us distrustingly,<br>
    as he shivered, soaked in grog,<br>
    then bitterly he snapped these words,<br>
    "Who moved me flaming dog ?"
  </p>
