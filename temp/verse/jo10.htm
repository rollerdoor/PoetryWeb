    At Casey's After Mass

    There's a weather-beaten sign-post where the
    track turns towards the west,<br>
    Through the tall, white, slender timber, in the land I love the best.<br>
    Short its message is - "To Casey's" - for it points the road to Casey's;<br>
    And my homing heart goes bushwards on an idle roving quest,<br>
    Down the old, old road contented, o'er the gum-leaves crisp and scented,<br>
    Where a deft hand splashed the purple on the big hill's sombre crest.<br>
    Ah, it's long, long years and dreary, many, many steps and weary,<br>
    Back to where the lingering dew of morn bedecked the barley-grass,<br>
    When I watched the wild careering of the neighbours through the clearing<br>
    Down that sweet bush track to Casey's, o'er the paddock down to Casey's;<br>
    Spending Sunday down at Casey's after Mass.

  <p>
    For, as soon as Mass was over, round the church they swarmed like bees,<br>
    Filled their pipes and duly lit them, brushed the dust from off their knees;<br>
    Then they'd " ready-up " for Casey's - self-invited down to Casey's -<br>
    Harness horses for the women with a bushman's careless ease.<br>
    With a neat spring to the saddle, soon would start the wild skedaddle.<br>
    Passing gigs and traps and buggies packed as tight as they could squeeze;<br>
    Hearts as buoyant as a feather in the mellow autumn weather,<br>
    While the noisy minahs cheered to see the glad procession pass -<br>
    All the Regans and the Ryans, and the whole mob of O'Briens<br>
    Bringing up the rear to Casey's -in the Shandrydan to Casey's -<br>
    Spending Sunday down at Casey's after Mass.
  </p>

  <p>
    Past the kitchen door they rattled and they took the horses out;<br>
    While the women went inside at once, the menfolk hung about<br>
    Round the stable down at Casey's, waiting dinner down at Casey's;<br>
    And they talked about the Government, and blamed it for the drought,<br>
    Sitting where the sunlight lingers, picking splinters from their fingers,<br>
    Settling all the problems of the world beyond a chance of doubt.<br>
    From inside there came the bustle of the cheerful wholesome hustle,<br>
    As dear old Mrs. Casey tried all records to surpass;<br>
    Oh, there's many a memory blesses her sweet silver-braided tresses;<br>
    They were "lovely" down at Casey's - always joking down at Casey's -<br>
    Spending Sunday down at Casey's after Mass.
  </p>

  <p>
    So they called us in to dinner, five-and-twenty guests -and more -<br>
    At the longest kitchen-table ever stood upon a floor.<br>
    There was plenty down at Casey's -ay, an open house was Casey's,<br>
    Where the neighbour and his missus never, never passed the door;<br>
    Where they counted kindly giving half the joy and pride of living<br>
    And the seasons came full-handed, and the angels blessed the store;<br>
    While the happy Laughing Mary flitted round us like a fairy.<br>
    And the big, shy boys stopped business, and looked up to watch her pass -<br>
    Ah, but when she caught them staring at the ribbons she was wearing!<br>
    Well, they spilled their tea at Casey's - on the good clean cloth at Casey's -<br>
    Spending Sunday down at Casey's after Mass.

  <p>
    Then the reckless feats of daring, and the bushman's fierce delight<br>
    When the brumby squealed and rooted, and the saddle-girths were tight!<br>
    They could ride 'em down at Casey's - stick like plasters down at Casey's -<br>
    When they noticed Mary looking, they would go with all their might;<br>
    Ho! they belted, and they clouted, and they yelled, and whooped, and shouted,<br>
    "Riding flash" to "ketch" the ladies, spurring, flogging, left and right!<br>
    And the lad with manners airy risked his neck for Laughing Mary<br>
    When he summoned all his courage up a rival to surpass;<br>
    Oh, the fun went fast and faster, as he landed in disaster<br>
    In the puddle-hole at Casey's -with his brand new suit at Casey's -<br>
    Spending Sunday down at Casey's after Mass.

  <p>
    Hoary, hale, bewhiskered veterans, perched like mopokes in a row,<br>
    Out of danger on the top-rail, gave advice to those below;<br>
    They were wonders down at Casey's, were the old men at the Caseys' -<br>
    They're the boys could ride the "bad 'uns" in the days of long ago!<br>
    Faith, and old man Casey told 'em of a way he had to hold 'em.<br>
    Man, "the deuce an outlaw thrun him," when he "got a proper show";<br>
    Ay, and each man "upped and showed 'em" how he "handled 'em, an' rode 'em" -<br>
    Pshaw! there never was a native these old rides could outclass.<br>
    Once again they were "among 'em," and they "roped 'em" and they "slung 'em"<br>
    On the stockyard fence at Casey's - smoking, pitchin'," down at Casey's -<br>
    Spending Sunday down at Casey's after Mass.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hard and cold is youth to fancies which around the old men cling;<br>
    So they left them perched upon the rail to swap their vapouring,<br>
    Took a seat inside at Casey's, on the good chairs at the Caseys';<br>
    While the Caseys' new piano made the old house rock and ring.<br>
    There their mild eyes stared and glistened, as they sat around and listened<br>
    To the tuneful little ditties Laughing Mary used to sing;<br>
    There they rubbed their chins and reckoned that to no one was she second -<br>
    "Cripes, she'd sing the blooming head off any singer in her class!"<br>
    And the banter and the laughter when the chorus hit the rafter!<br>
    It was "great" to be at Casey's - healthy, wholesome fun at Casey's -<br>
    Spending Sunday down at Casey's after Mass.
  </p>

  <p>
    There was something in the old life which I cannot quite forget;<br>
    There are happy golden memories that hover round me yet -<br>
    Something special down at Casey's, in that wonderland of Casey's,<br>
    Where the crowfoot and the clover spread a downy coverlet,<br>
    Where the trees seemed always greener, where the life of man was cleaner,<br>
    And the joys that grew around us shed no leaves of brown regret.<br>
    oh, the merry, merry party! oh, the simple folk and hearty,<br>
    Who can fling their cares behind them, and forget them while they pass<br>
    Simple lives and simple pleasure never stinted in the measure.<br>
    There was something down at Casey's, something clean and good at Casey's -<br>
    Spending Sunday down at Casey's after Mass.
  </p>

  <p>
    Passed and gone that old bush homestead where the hours too swiftly flew;<br>
    Silent now the merry voices of the happy friends I knew;<br>
    We have drifted far from Casey's. All deserted now is Casey's -<br>
    Just a lone brick chimney standing, and a garden-tree or two.<br>
    Still the minahs love to linger where the sign-post points the finger<br>
    Down the bush track winding westward where the tall white timber grew.<br>
    But the big hill seems to wonder why the ties are snapped asunder,<br>
    Why the neighbours never gather, never loiter as they pass;<br>
    Yet a tear-stained thought beseeming comes along and sets me dreaming<br>
    That I'm back again at Casey's, with the old, old friends at Casey's;<br>
    Spending Sunday down at Casey's after Mass.
