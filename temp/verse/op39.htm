  <p>
    The old bush-whacker bowed his head,<br>
    And mournfully he sighed and sighed<br>
    Like one who has not tasted bread<br>
    Or meat or beer since morning-tide.
  </p>

  <p>
    And I, in that old shanty-bar,<br>
    In sympathy above him bent,<br>
    And said, 'Friend, is it ill you are?<br>
    Or broken by some sad event?
  </p>

  <p>
    'Oh, sad, indeed! Oh, sad, indeed!'<br>
    He paused to drink a proffered beer,<br>
    Regardless that the foaming mead<br>
    He swelled with many a scalding tear.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then, as he choked a great sob back,<br>
    (Or one last mouthful left behind),<br>
    He said, 'For years I've tried this track,<br>
    And all the cockies have been kind.
  </p>

  <p>
    'But now they've got no time for Bill,<br>
    And yakker they so basely shirk '<br>
    Their laziness has grown until<br>
    They ask me if I'll do their work.'
  </p>

  <p>
    Another tear dropped in his pot;<br>
    Another mournful sigh he drew,<br>
    Then added, 'Lord, I don't know wot<br>
    Orstralier is comin' to.'
