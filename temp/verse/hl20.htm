    A Prouder Man Than You

    If you fancy that your people came of better stock than mine,<br>
    If you hint of higher breeding by a word or by a sign,<br>
    If you're proud because of fortune or the clever things you do —<br>
    Then I'll play no second fiddle: I'm a prouder man than you!
  </p>

  <p>
    If you think that your profession has the more gentility,<br>
    And that you are condescending to be seen along with me;<br>
    If you notice that I'm shabby while your clothes are spruce and new —<br>
    You have only got to hint it: I'm a prouder man than you!
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have a swell companion when you see me on the street,<br>
    And you think that I'm too common for your toney friend to meet,<br>
    So that I, in passing closely, fail to come within your view —<br>
    Then be blind to me for ever: I'm a prouder man than you!
  </p>

  <p>
    If your character be blameless, if your outward past be clean,<br>
    While 'tis known my antecedents are not what they should have been,<br>
    Do not risk contamination, save your name whate'er you do —<br>
    `Birds o' feather fly together': I'm a prouder bird than you!
  </p>

  <p>
    Keep your patronage for others! Gold and station cannot hide<br>
    Friendship that can laugh at fortune, friendship that can conquer pride!<br>
    Offer this as to an equal — let me see that you are true,<br>
    And my wall of pride is shattered: I am not so proud as you!
