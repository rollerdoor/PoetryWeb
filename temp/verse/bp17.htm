    It lies beyond the Western Pines<br>
    Towards the sinking sun,<br>
    And not a survey mark defines<br>
    The bounds of "Brumby's Run".
  </p>

  <p>
    On odds and ends of mountain land,<br>
    On tracks of range and rock<br>
    Where no one else can make a stand,<br>
    Old Brumby rears his stock.
  </p>

  <p>
    A wild, unhandled lot they are<br>
    Of every shape and breed.<br>
    They venture out 'neath moon and star<br>
    Along the flats to feed;
  </p>

  <p>
    But when the dawn makes pink the sky<br>
    And steals along the plain,<br>
    The Brumby horses turn and fly<br>
    Towards the hills again.
  </p>

  <p>
    The traveller by the mountain-track<br>
    May hear their hoof-beats pass,<br>
    And catch a glimpse of brown and black<br>
    Dim shadows on the grass.
  </p>

  <p>
    The eager stockhorse pricks his ears<br>
    And lifts his head on high<br>
    In wild excitement when he hears<br>
    The Brumby mob go by.
  </p>

  <p>
    Old Brumby asks no price or fee<br>
    O'er all his wide domains:<br>
    The man who yards his stock is free<br>
    To keep them for his pains.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, off to scour the mountain-side<br>
    With eager eyes aglow,<br>
    To strongholds where the wild mobs hide<br>
    The gully-rakers go.
  </p>

  <p>
    A rush of horses through the trees,<br>
    A red shirt making play;<br>
    A sound of stockwhips on the breeze,<br>
    They vanish far away!
  </p>

  <p>
    Ah, me! before our day is done<br>
    We long with bitter pain<br>
    To ride once more on Brumby's Run<br>
    And yard his mob again.
