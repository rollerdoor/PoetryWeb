  <p>
    The heart that once was rich with light,<br>
    And happy in your grace,<br>
    Now lieth cold beneath the scorn<br>
    That gathers on your face;<br>
    And every joy it knew before,<br>
    And every templed dream,<br>
    Is paler than the dying flash<br>
    On yonder mountain stream.<br>
    The soul, regretting foundered bliss<br>
    Amid the wreck of years,<br>
    Hath mourned it with intensity<br>
    Too deep for human tears!
  </p>

  <p>
    The forest fadeth underneath<br>
    The blast that rushes by —<br>
    The dripping leaves are white with death,<br>
    But Love will never die!<br>
    We both have seen the starry moss<br>
    That clings where Ruin reigns,<br>
    And ~one~ must know ~his~ lonely breast<br>
    Affection still retains;<br>
    Through all the sweetest hopes of life,<br>
    That clustered round and round,<br>
    Are lying now, like withered things,<br>
    Forsaken — on the ground.
  </p>

  <p>
    'Tis hard to think of what we were,<br>
    And what we might have been,<br>
    Had not an evil spirit crept<br>
    Across the tranquil scene:<br>
    Had fervent feelings in your soul<br>
    Not failed nor ceased to shine<br>
    As pure as those existing on,<br>
    And burning still in mine.<br>
    Had every treasure at your feet<br>
    That I was wont to pour,<br>
    Been never thrown like worthless weeds<br>
    Upon a barren shore!
  </p>

  <p>
    The bitter edge of grief has passed,<br>
    I would not now upbraid;<br>
    Or count to you the broken vows,<br>
    So often idly made!<br>
    I would not cross your path to chase<br>
    The falsehood from your brow —<br>
    I ~know~, with all that borrowed light,<br>
    You are not happy now:<br>
    Since those that once have trampled down<br>
    Affection's early claim,<br>
    Have lost a peace they need not hope<br>
    To find on earth again.
