  <p>
    These black bush-waters, heavy with crusted boughs<br>
    Like plumes above dead captains, wake the mind....<br>
    Uncounted kissing, unremembered vows,<br>
    Nights long forgotten, moons too dark to find,<br>
    Or stars too cold...all quick things that have fled<br>
    Whilst these old bubbles uprise in older stone,<br>
    Return like pale dead faces of children dead,<br>
    Staring unfelt through doors for ever unknown.
  </p>

  <p>
    O silent ones that drink these timeless pools,<br>
    Eternal brothers, bending so deeply over,<br>
    Your branches tremble above my tears again...<br>
    And even my songs are stolen from some old lover<br>
    Who cried beneath your leaves like other fools,<br>
    While still they whisper "in vain...in vain...in vain..."
