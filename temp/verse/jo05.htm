    On the Sunday morning mustered,<br>
    Yarning at our ease;<br>
    Buggies, traps and jinkers clustered<br>
    Underneath the trees,<br>
    Horses tethered to the fences;<br>
    Thus we hold our conferences<br>
    Waiting till the priest commences-<br>
    Pitchin' at the Church.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sheltering in the summer's shining<br>
    Where the shadows fall;<br>
    When the winter's sun is pining,<br>
    Lined along the wall;<br>
    Yarning, reckoning, ruminating,<br>
    "Yeos" and lambs and wool debating,<br>
    Squatting, smoking, idly waiting-<br>
    Pitchin' at the Church.
  </p>

  <p>
    Young bloods gathered from the others<br>
    Tell their dreamings o'er;<br>
    Beaded-bonneted old mothers<br>
    Grouped around the door;<br>
    Dainty bush girls, trim and fairy,<br>
    All that's neat and sweet and airy-<br>
    Nell, and Kate, and Laughing Mary'-<br>
    Pitchin' at the Church.
  </p>

  <p>
    Up comes someone briskly driving,<br>
    "Cutting matters fine :"<br>
    All his "fam'ly lot" arriving<br>
    Wander in a line<br>
    Off in some precise direction,<br>
    Till they find their proper section,<br>
    Greet it with an interjection-<br>
    Pitchin' at the Church.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Mornun', Jack." "Good mornun', Martin."<br>
    "Keepin' pretty dry!"<br>
    "When d'you think you'll finish cartin'?"<br>
    "Prices ain't too high ?"<br>
    Round about the yarnin' strayin'-<br>
    Dances, sickness-frocks surveyin'-<br>
    Wheat is "growed," the "hens is layin'"-<br>
    Pitchin' at the Church.
