  <p>
    Above the ashes straight and tall,<br>
    Through ferns with moisture dripping,<br>
    I climb beneath the sandstone wall,<br>
    My feet on mosses slipping.
  </p>

  <p>
    Like ramparts round the valley's edge<br>
    The tinted cliffs are standing,<br>
    With many a broken wall and ledge,<br>
    And many a rocky landing.
  </p>

  <p>
    And round about their rugged feet<br>
    Deep ferny dells are hidden<br>
    In shadowed depths, whence dust and heat<br>
    Are banished and forbidden.
  </p>

  <p>
    The stream that, crooning to itself,<br>
    Comes down a tireless rover,<br>
    Flows calmly to the rocky shelf,<br>
    And there leaps bravely over.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now pouring down, now lost in spray<br>
    When mountain breezes sally,<br>
    The water strikes the rock midway,<br>
    And leaps into the valley.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now in the west the colours change,<br>
    The blue with crimson blending;<br>
    Behind the far Dividing Range,<br>
    The sun is fast descending.
  </p>

  <p>
    And mellowed day comes o'er the place,<br>
    And softens ragged edges;<br>
    The rising moon's great placid face<br>
    Looks gravely o'er the ledges.
  </p>
