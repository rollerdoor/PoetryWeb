    Four horsemen rode out from the heart of the range,<br>
    Four horsemen with aspects forbidding and strange.<br>
    They were booted and spurred, they were armed to the teeth,<br>
    And they frowned as they looked on the valley beneath,<br>
    As forward they rode through the rocks and the fern — <br>
    Ned Kelly, Dan Kelly, Steve Hart and Joe Byrne.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ned Kelly drew rein and he shaded his eyes —<br>
    "The town's at our mercy! See yonder it lies!<br>
    To hell with the troopers!" — he shook his clenched fist — <br>
    "We will shoot them like dogs if they dare to resist!"<br>
    And all of them nodded, grim-visaged and stern — <br>
    Ned Kelly, Dan Kelly, Steve Hart and Joe Byrne.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through the gullies and creeks they rode silently down;<br>
    They stuck-up the station and raided the town;<br>
    They opened the safe and they looted the bank;<br>
    They laughed and were merry, they ate and they drank.<br>
    Then off to the ranges they went with their gold —<br>
    Oh! never were bandits more reckless and bold.
  </p>

  <p>
    But time brings its punishment, time travels fast — <br>
    And the outlaws were trapped in Glenrowan at last,<br>
    Where three of them died in the smoke and the flame,<br>
    And Ned Kelly came back — to the last he was game.<br>
    But the Law shot him down (he was fated to hang), <br>
    And that was the end of the bushranging gang.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whatever their faults and whatever their crimes,<br>
    Their deeds lend romance to those faraway times.<br>
    They have gone from the gullies they haunted of old,<br>
    And nobody knows where they buried their gold.<br>
    To the ranges they loved they will never return — <br>
    Ned Kelly, Dan Kelly, Steve Hart and Joe Byrne.
  </p>

  <p>
    But at times when I pass through that sleepy old town<br>
    Where the far-distant peaks of Strathbogie look down<br>
    I think of the days when those grim ranges rang<br>
    To the galloping hooves of the bushranging gang.<br>
    Though the years bring oblivion, time brings a change,<br>
    The ghosts of the Kellys still ride from the range.
