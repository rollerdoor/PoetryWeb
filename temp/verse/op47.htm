  <p>
    I span and Eve span<br>
    A thread to bind the heart of man;<br>
    But the heart of man was a wandering thing<br>
    That came and went with little to bring:<br>
    Nothing he minded what we made,<br>
    As here he loitered, and there he stayed.
  </p>

  <p>
    I span and Eve span<br>
    A thread to bind the heart of man;<br>
    But the more we span the more we found<br>
    It wasn't his heart but ours we bound.<br>
    For children gathered about our knees:<br>
    The thread was a chain that stole our ease.<br>
    And one of us learned in our children's eyes<br>
    That more than man was love and prize.<br>
    But deep in the heart of one of us lay<br>
    A root of loss and hidden dismay.
  </p>

  <p>
    He said he was strong. He had no strength<br>
    But that which comes of breadth and length.<br>
    He said he was fond. But his fondness proved<br>
    The flame of an hour when he was moved.<br>
    He said he was true. His truth was but<br>
    A door that winds could open and shut.
  </p>

  <p>
    And yet, and yet, as he came back,<br>
    Wandering in from the outward track,<br>
    We held our arms, and gave him our breast,<br>
    As a pillowing place for his head to rest.<br>
    I span and Eve span,<br>
    A thread to bind the heart of man!
