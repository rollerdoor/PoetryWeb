  <p>
    Let us cease our idle chatter,<br>
    Let the tears bedew our cheek,<br>
    For a man from Tallangatta<br>
    Has been missing for a week.
  </p>

  <p>
    Where the roaring flooded Murray<br>
    Covered all the lower land,<br>
    There he started in a hurry,<br>
    With a bottle in his hand.
  </p>

  <p>
    And his fate is hid for ever,<br>
    But the public seem to think<br>
    That he slumbered by the river,<br>
    'Neath the influence of drink.
  </p>

  <p>
    And they scarcely seem to wonder<br>
    That the river, wide and deep,<br>
    Never woke him with its thunder,<br>
    Never stirred him in his sleep.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the crashing logs came sweeping,<br>
    And their tumult filled the air,<br>
    Then M'Ginnis murmured, sleeping,<br>
    'Tis a wake in ould Kildare.'
  </p>

  <p>
    So the river rose and found him<br>
    Sleeping softly by the stream,<br>
    And the cruel waters drowned him<br>
    Ere he wakened from his dream.
  </p>

  <p>
    And the blossom-tufted wattle,<br>
    Blooming brightly on the lea,<br>
    Saw M'Ginnis and the bottle<br>
    Going drifting out to sea.
  </p>
