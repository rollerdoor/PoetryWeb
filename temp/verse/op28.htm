    It was in the Queensland drought;<br>
    And over hill and dell,<br>
    No grass — the water far apart,<br>
    All dry and hot as hell.<br>
    The wretched bullock teams drew up<br>
    Beside a water-hole —<br>
    They'd struggled on through dust and drought<br>
    For days to reach this goal.
    And though the water rendered forth<br>
    A rank, unholy stench,<br>
    The bullocks and the bullockies<br>
    Drank deep their thirst to quench.
  </p>

  <p>
    Two of the drivers cursed and swore<br>
    As only drivers can.<br>
    The other one, named Daniel,<br>
    Best known as Holy Dan,<br>
    Admonished them and said it was<br>
    The Lord's all-wise decree;<br>
    And if they'd only watch and wait,<br>
    A change they'd quickly see.
  </p>

  <p>
    'Twas strange that of Dan's bullocks<br>
    Not one had gone aloft,<br>
    But this, he said, was due to prayer<br>
    And supplication oft.<br>
    At last one died but Dan was calm,<br>
    He hardly seemed to care;<br>
    He knelt beside the bullock's corpse<br>
    And offered up a prayer.
  </p>

  <p>
    "One bullock Thou has taken, Lord,<br>
    And so it seemeth best.<br>
    Thy will be done, but see my need<br>
    And spare to me the rest!"
  </p>

  <p>
    A month went by. Dan's bullocks now<br>
    Were dying every day,<br>
    But still on each occasion would<br>
    The faithful fellow pray,<br>
    "Another Thou has taken, Lord,<br>
    And so it seemeth best.<br>
    Thy will be done, but see my need,<br>
    And spare to me the rest!"
  </p>

  <p>
    And still they camped beside the hole,<br>
    And still it never rained,<br>
    And still Dan's bullocks died and died,<br>
    Till only one remained.<br>
    Then Dan broke down — good Holy Dan —<br>
    The man who never swore.<br>
    He knelt beside the latest corpse,<br>
    And here's the prayer he prore.
  </p>

  <p>
    "That'snineteen Thou has taken, Lord,<br>
    And now You'll plainly see<br>
    You'd better take the bloody lot,<br>
    One's no damn good to me."<br>
    The other riders laughed so much<br>
    They shook the sky around;<br>
    The lightning flashed, the thunder roared,<br>
    And Holy Dan was drowned.
