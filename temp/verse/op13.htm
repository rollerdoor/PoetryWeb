    "You talk of snakes," said Jack the Rat,"<br>
    But, blow me, one hot summer, <br>
    I seen a thing that knocked me flat<br>
    Fourteen foot long, or more than that, <br>
    It was a regular hummer! <br>
    Lay right along a sort of bog, <br>
    Just like a log!
  </p>

  <p>
    "The ugly thing was lyin' there <br>
    And not a sign o' movin', <br>
    Give any man a nasty scare; <br>
    Seen nothin' like it anywhere <br>
    Since I first started drovin'. <br>
    And yet it didn't scare my dog. <br>
    <span class="ital">Looked</span> like a log!
  </p>

  <p>
    I had to cross that bog, yer see, <br>
    And blue I was humpin'; <br>
    But wonderin' what that thing could be <br>
    A-layin' there in front o' me <br>
    I didn't feel like jumpin'. <br>
    Yet, though I shivered like a frog, <br>
    It <span class="ital">seemed</span> a log!
  </p>

  <p>
    I takes a leap and lands right on <br>
    The back of that there whopper!" He stopped. <br>
    We waited. Then Big Mac Remarked, "<br>
    Well, then, what happened, Jack?" <br>
    "Not much," said Jack, and drained his grog. <br>
    It was a log!"
