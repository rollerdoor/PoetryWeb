    Great gums creak against the breeze<br>
    That bears a mystic scent<br>
    Is that the tang of pepper trees<br>
    From over yonder fence?<br>
    The sun has faded in the west<br>
    And evening's shroud is falling<br>
    Now we must put all else at rest<br>
    The internet is calling.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gently, fingers keyboards kiss<br>
    As our excitement blossoms<br>
    Hard drives hum and modems hiss<br>
    All else is now forgotten.<br>
    Connections made across the globe<br>
    This system is astounding<br>
    The world is ours, all free to roam<br>
    Without in airports lounging.
  </p>

  <p>
    The friends we meet the world around<br>
    From countries wide and wondrous<br>
    With tales that do our minds astound<br>
    Of places foreign to us.<br>
    In Adelaide the bushfires rage,<br>
    In Arkansas it's snowing<br>
    The Queensland folk are battling floods<br>
    Somewhere a gales blowing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then when at last the daemon comes<br>
    And we are near expended<br>
    We ponder should we try again<br>
    Or abandon things not ended.<br>
    A latenight chat or secret tryst<br>
    Across the global vein<br>
    Tis sure that friend we'll sorely miss<br>
    Until we chat again.
