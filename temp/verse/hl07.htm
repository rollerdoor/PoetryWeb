  <p>
    Three bushmen one morning rode up to an inn,<br>
    And one of them called for the drinks with a grin;<br>
    They'd only returned from a trip to the North,<br>
    And, eager to greet them, the landlord came forth.<br>
    He absently poured out a glass of Three Star,<br>
    And set down that drink with the rest on the bar.</p>

  <p>"There, that is for Harry," he said, "and it's queer,<br>
    'Tis the very same glass that he drank from last year;<br>
    His name's on the glass, you can read it like print,<br>
    He scratched it himself with an old bit of flint;<br>
    I remember his drink — it was always Three Star" —<br>
    And the landlord looked out through the door of the bar.</p>

  <p>He looked at the horses, and counted but three:<br>
    "You were always together — where's Harry?" cried he.<br>
    Oh, sadly they looked at the glass as they said,<br>
    "You may put it away, for our old mate is dead;"<br>
    But one, gazing out o'er the ridges afar,<br>
    Said, "We owe him a shout — leave the glass on the bar."</p>

  <p>They thought of the far-away grave on the plain,<br>
    They thought of the comrade who came not again,<br>
    They lifted their glasses, and sadly they said:<br>
    "We drink to the name of the mate who is dead."<br>
    And the sunlight streamed in, and a light like a star<br>
    Seemed to glow in the depth of the glass on the bar.</p>

  <p>And still in that shanty a tumbler is seen,<br>
    It stands by the clock, always polished and clean;<br>
    And often the strangers will read as they pass<br>
    The name of a bushman engraved on the glass;<br>
    And though on the shelf but a dozen there are,<br>
    That glass never stands with the rest on the bar.</p>
