  <p>
    The swagman sat upon a log beside a waterhole<br>
    And eyed Matilda on the ground with anguish in his soul.<br>
    He drew his hand across his eyes as far across the plain<br>
    Came wafted down the forest aisles the whistle of a train.
  </p>

  <p>
    Again he looked to where she lay insensate on the clay,<br>
    While slow the lengthened shadows barred the even of the day.<br>
    He saw how shrunken was her form, how wrinkled, old and worn,<br>
    And felt a tugging at his heart as if its strings were torn.
  </p>

  <p>
    'Farewell, Matilda! you have been my partner all these years<br>
    Upon life's journey through the west, with all its smiles and tears;<br>
    But now, alas! the times are changed, and this can never be,<br>
    For where your form was welcome once you now meet obloquy.'
  </p>

  <p>
    The swagman paused and bared his head beneath the darkened sky;<br>
    Then raised Matilda in his arms and breathed a last good-bye.<br>
    The brand of Cain was on his brow, but anguish in his soul,<br>
    As, with a frenzied cry, he cast her in the waterhole.<br>
    A startled night-bird gave a scream and Happed across his sight '<br>
    "Matilda's ghost!" he gasped, and fled, a madman through the night.
