  <p>
    No song is this of leaf and bird,<br>
    And gracious waters flowing;<br>
    I'm sick at heart, for I have heard<br>
    Big Billy Vickers "blowing".
  </p>

  <p>
    He'd never take a leading place<br>
    In chambers legislative:<br>
    This booby with the vacant face —<br>
    This hoddy-doddy native!
  </p>

  <p>
    Indeed, I'm forced to say aside,<br>
    To you, O reader, solely,<br>
    He only wants the horns and hide<br>
    To be a bullock wholly.
  </p>

  <p>
    But, like all noodles, he is vain;<br>
    And when his tongue is wagging,<br>
    I feel inclined to copy Cain,<br>
    And "drop" him for his bragging.
  </p>

  <p>
    He, being Bush-bred, stands, of course,<br>
    Six feet his dirty socks in;<br>
    His lingo is confined to horse<br>
    And plough, and pig and oxen.
  </p>

  <p>
    Two years ago he'd less to say<br>
    Within his little circuit;<br>
    But now he has, besides a dray,<br>
    A team of twelve to work it.
  </p>

  <p>
    No wonder is it that he feels<br>
    Inclined to clack and rattle<br>
    About his bullocks and his wheels —<br>
    He owns a dozen cattle.
  </p>

  <p>
    In short, to be exact and blunt,<br>
    In his own estimation<br>
    He's "out and out" the head and front<br>
    Top-sawyer of creation!
  </p>

  <p>
    For, mark me, he can "sit a buck"<br>
    For hours and hours together;<br>
    And never horse has had the luck<br>
    To pitch him from the leather.
  </p>

  <p>
    If ever he should have a "spill"<br>
    Upon the grass or gravel,<br>
    Be sure of this, the saddle will<br>
    With Billy Vickers travel.
  </p>

  <p>
    At punching oxen you may guess<br>
    There's nothing out can "camp" him:<br>
    He has, in fact, the slouch and dress<br>
    Which bullock-driver stamp him.
  </p>

  <p>
    I do not mean to give offence,<br>
    But I have vainly striven<br>
    To ferret out the difference<br>
    'Twixt driver and the driven.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of course, the statements herein made<br>
    In every other stanza<br>
    Are Billy's own; and I'm afraid<br>
    They're stark extravaganza.
  </p>

  <p>
    I feel constrained to treat as trash<br>
    His noisy fiddle-faddle<br>
    About his doings with the lash,<br>
    His feats upon the saddle.
  </p>

  <p>
    But grant he "knows his way about",<br>
    Or grant that he is silly,<br>
    There cannot be the slightest doubt<br>
    Of Billy's faith in Billy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of all the doings of the day<br>
    His ignorance is utter;<br>
    But he can quote the price of hay,<br>
    The current rate of butter.
  </p>

  <p>
    His notions of our leading men<br>
    Are mixed and misty very:<br>
    He knows a cochin-china hen —<br>
    He never speaks of Berry.
  </p>

  <p>
    As you'll assume, he hasn't heard<br>
    Of Madame Patti's singing;<br>
    But I will stake my solemn word<br>
    He knows what maize is bringing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Surrounded by majestic peaks,<br>
    By lordly mountain ranges,<br>
    Where highest voice of thunder speaks<br>
    His aspect never changes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The grand Pacific there beyond<br>
    His dirty hut is glowing:<br>
    He only sees a big salt pond,<br>
    O'er which his grain is going.
  </p>

  <p>
    The sea that covers half the sphere,<br>
    With all its stately speeches,<br>
    Is held by Bill to be a mere<br>
    Broad highway for his peaches.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through Nature's splendid temples he<br>
    Plods, under mountains hoary;<br>
    But he has not the eyes to see<br>
    Their grandeur and their glory.
  </p>

  <p>
    A bullock in a biped's boot,<br>
    I iterate, is Billy!<br>
    He crushes with a careless foot<br>
    The touching water-lily.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've said enough — I'll let him go!<br>
    If he could read these verses,<br>
    He'd pepper me for hours, I know,<br>
    With his peculiar curses.
  </p>

  <p>
    But this is sure, he'll never change<br>
    His manners loud and flashy,<br>
    Nor learn with neatness to arrange<br>
    His clothing, cheap and trashy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Like other louts, he'll jog along,<br>
    And swig at shanty liquors,<br>
    And chew and spit. Here ends the song<br>
    Of Mr. Billy Vickers.
  </p>
