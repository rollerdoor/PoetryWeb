  <p>
    Good people all, of every sort,<br>
    Give ear unto my song;<br>
    And if you find it wond'rous short,<br>
    It cannot hold you long.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Islington there was a man,<br>
    Of whom the world might say,<br>
    That still a godly race he ran,<br>
    Whene'er he went to pray.
  </p>

  <p>
    A kind and gentle heart he had,<br>
    To comfort friends and foes;<br>
    The naked every day he clad,<br>
    When he put on his clothes.
  </p>

  <p>
    And in that town a dog was found,<br>
    As many dogs there be,<br>
    Both mongrel, puppy, whelp, and hound,<br>
    And curs of low degree.
  </p>

  <p>
    This dog and man at first were friends;<br>
    But when a pique began,<br>
    The dog, to gain some private ends,<br>
    Went mad and bit the man.
  </p>

  <p>
    Around from all the neighbouring streets<br>
    The wond'ring neighbours ran,<br>
    And swore the dog had lost his wits,<br>
    To bite so good a man.
  </p>

  <p>
    The wound it seem'd both sore and sad,<br>
    To every Christian eye;<br>
    And while they swore the dog was mad,<br>
    They swore the man would die.
  </p>

  <p>
    But soon a wonder come to light,<br>
    That show'd the rogues they lied:<br>
    The man recover'd of the bite,<br>
    The dog it was that died.
