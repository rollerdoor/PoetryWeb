<div class="verse">
  <p>
    Across the stony ridges,<br>
    Across the rolling plain,<br>
    Young Harry Dale, the drover,<br>
    Comes riding home again.<br>
    And well his stock-horse bears him,<br>
    And light of heart is he,<br>
    And stoutly his old packhorse<br>
    Is trotting by his knee.</p>

  <p>Up Queensland way with cattle<br>
    He's travelled regions vast,<br>
    And many months have vanished<br>
    Since home-folks saw him last.<br>
    He hums a song of someone<br>
    He hopes to marry soon;<br>
    And hobble-chains and camp-ware <br>
    Keep jingling to the tune.</p>

  <p>Beyond the hazy dado<br>
    Against the lower skies<br>
    And yon blue line of ranges<br>
    The station homestead lies.<br>
    And thitherward the drover<br>
    Jogs through the lazy noon,<br>
    While hobble-chains and camp-ware<br>
    Are jingling to a tune.</p>

  <p>An hour has filled the heavens<br>
    With storm-clouds inky black;<br>
    At times the lightning trickles<br>
    Around the drover's track;<br>
    But Harry pushes onward,<br>
    His horses' strength he tries,<br>
    In hope to reach the river<br>
    Before the flood shall rise.</p>

  <p>The thunder, pealing o'er him,<br>
    Goes rumbling down the plain;<br>
    And sweet on thirsty pastures<br>
    Beats fast the plashing rain;<br>
    Then every creek and gully<br>
    Sends forth its tribute flood -<br>
    The river runs a banker,<br>
    All stained with yellow mud.</p>

  <p>Now Harry speaks to Rover,<br>
    The best dog on the plains,<br>
    And to his hardy horses,<br>
    And strokes their shaggy manes:<br>
    "We've breasted bigger rivers<br>
    When Hoods were at their height,<br>
    Nor shall this gutter stop us<br>
    From getting home tonight!"</p>

  <p>The thunder growls a warning,<br>
    The blue, forked lightning's gleam;<br>
    The drover turns his horses<br>
    To swim the fatal stream.<br>
    But, oh! the flood runs stronger<br>
    Than e'er it ran before;<br>
    The saddle-horse is failing,<br>
    And only half-way o'er!</p>

  <p>When flashes next the lightning<br>
    The flood's grey breast is blank;<br>
    A cattle-dog and packhorse<br>
    Are struggling up the bank.<br>
    But in the lonely homestead<br>
    The girl shall wait in vain -<br>
    He'll never pass the stations<br>
    In charge of stock again.</p>

  <p>The faithful dog a moment<br>
    Lies panting on the bank,<br>
    Then plunges through the current<br>
    To where his master sank.<br>
    And round and round in circles<br>
    He fights with failing strength,<br>
    Till, gripped by wilder waters,<br>
    He fails and sinks at length.</p>

  <p>Across the flooded lowlands<br>
    And slopes of sodden loam<br>
    The packhorse struggles bravely<br>
    To take dumb tidings home;<br>
    And mud-stained, wet, and weary,<br>
    He goes by rock and tree,<br>
    With clanging chains and tinware<br>
    All sounding eerily.</p>
