    It chanced upon the very day we'd got the shearing done,<br>
    A buggy brought a stranger to the West-o'-Sunday Run;<br>
    He had a round and jolly face, and he was sleek and stout,<br>
    He drove right up between the huts and called the super out.<br>
    We chaps were smoking after tea, and heard the swell enquire<br>
    For one as travelled by the name of `Dunn of Nevertire'.<br>
    <span class="ital">
      Jack Dunn of Nevertire,<br>
      Poor Dunn of Nevertire;
    </span><br>
    There wasn't one of us but knew Jack Dunn of Nevertire.
  </p>

  <p>
    `Jack Dunn of Nevertire,' he said; `I was a mate of his;<br>
    And now it's twenty years since I set eyes upon his phiz.<br>
    There is no whiter man than Jack -- no straighter south the line,<br>
    There is no hand in all the land I'd sooner grip in mine;<br>
    To help a mate in trouble Jack would go through flood and fire.<br>
    Great Scott! and don't you know the name of Dunn of Nevertire?<br>
    <span class="ital">
      Big Dunn of Nevertire,<br>
      Long Jack from Nevertire;
    </span><br>
    He stuck to me through thick and thin, Jack Dunn of Nevertire.
  </p>

  <p>`I did a wild and foolish thing while Jack and I were mates,<br>
    And I disgraced my guv'nor's name, an' wished to try the States.<br>
    My lamps were turned to Yankee Land, for I'd some people there,<br>
    And I was right when someone sent the money for my fare;<br>
    I thought 'twas Dad until I took the trouble to enquire,<br>
    And found that he who sent the stuff was Dunn of Nevertire,<br>
    <span class="ital">
      Jack Dunn of Nevertire,<br>
      Soft Dunn of Nevertire;
    </span><br>
    He'd won some money on a race -- Jack Dunn of Nevertire.
  </p>

  <p>`Now I've returned, by Liverpool, a swell of Yankee brand,<br>
    To reckon, guess, and kalkilate, 'n' wake my native land;<br>
    There is no better land, I swear, in all the wide world round --<br>
    I smelt the bush a month before we touched King George's Sound!<br>
    And now I've come to settle down, the top of my desire<br>
    Is just to meet a mate o' mine called `Dunn of Nevertire'.<br>
    <span class="ital">
      Was raised at Nevertire --<br>
      The town of Nevertire;
    </span><br>
    He humped his bluey by the name of `Dunn of Nevertire'.
  </p>

  <p>`I've heard he's poor, and if he is, a proud old fool is he;<br>
    But, spite of that, I'll find a way to fix the old gum-tree.<br>
    I've bought a station in the North -- the best that could be had;<br>
    I want a man to pick the stock -- I want a super bad;<br>
    I want no bully-brute to boss -- no crawling, sneaking liar --<br>
    My station super's name shall be `Jack Dunn of Nevertire'!<br>
    <span class="ital">
      Straight Dunn of Nevertire,<br>
      Old Dunn of Nevertire;
    </span><br>
    I guess he's known up Queensland way -- Jack Dunn of Nevertire.'
  </p>

  <p>The super said, while to his face a strange expression came:<br>
    `I THINK I've seen the man you want, I THINK I know the name;<br>
    Had he a jolly kind of face, a free and careless way,<br>
    Gray eyes that always seem'd to smile, and hair just turning gray --<br>
    Clean-shaved, except a light moustache, long-limbed, an' tough as wire?'<br>
    `THAT'S HIM! THAT'S DUNN!' the stranger roared, `Jack Dunn of Nevertire!<br>
    <span class="ital">
      John Dunn of Nevertire,<br>
      Jack D. from Nevertire,
    </span><br>
    They said I'd find him here, the cuss! -- Jack Dunn of Nevertire.
  </p>

  <p>`I'd know his walk,' the stranger cried, `though sobered, I'll allow.'<br>
    `I doubt it much,' the boss replied, `he don't walk that way now.'<br>
    `Perhaps he don't!' the stranger said, `for years were hard on Jack;<br>
    But, if he were a mile away, I swear I'd know his back.'<br>
    `I doubt it much,' the super said, and sadly puffed his briar,<br>
    `I guess he wears a pair of wings -- Jack Dunn of Nevertire;<br>
    <span class="ital">
      Jack Dunn of Nevertire,<br>
      Brave Dunn of Nevertire,
    </span><br>
    He caught a fever nursing me, Jack Dunn of Nevertire.'
  </p>

  <p>We took the stranger round to where a gum-tree stood alone,<br>
    And in the grass beside the trunk he saw a granite stone;<br>
    The names of Dunn and Nevertire were plainly written there --<br>
    `I'm all broke up,' the stranger said, in sorrow and despair,<br>
    `I guess he has a wider run, the man that I require;<br>
    He's got a river-frontage now, Jack Dunn of Nevertire;<br>
    <span class="ital">
      Straight Dunn of Nevertire,<br>
      White Jack from Nevertire,
    </span><br>
    I guess Saint Peter knew the name of `Dunn of Nevertire'.'
