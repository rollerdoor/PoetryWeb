  <p>
    Before the lad invested we had comfort here indeed;<br>
    Our lives were as an open book, and he who ran might read;<br>
    But now we live in other worlds, for since the motor came<br>
    My yoke-mate ne'er confides in me, or treats me quite the same.
  </p>

  <p>
    He used to be a candid man — I like him very well —<br>
    But lately I must pick the truth from what he does not tell;<br>
    The news he gives is watered, too, so when there's been defeat<br>
    I get one version here from him — another down the street.
  </p>

  <p>
    The madness got him bit by bit — I marked its sure advance;<br>
    An angashore upon a bike would land him in a trance;<br>
    He'd leave me talking to myself and watch it forge ahead,<br>
    And then he'd slowly stir himself and ask, "What's that you said'"
  </p>

  <p>
    Next, like a plague, loquacious men of marked civility<br>
    Swooped down, from heaven alone knows where, upon the presbytery;<br>
    Each bird of prey a cushat dove in downy meekness dressed,<br>
    And each a fine philanthropist to save him from the rest.
  </p>

  <p>
    And then typed letters came in sheaves, and pamphlets, too, galore,<br>
    The table there was strewn with them — I counted ten and more;<br>
    And morning, noon, and night he'd sit absorbing their contents,<br>
    The two heels round the bishop stuck with grave irreverence.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've never seen a homing soul so doubt-tossed, I must say,<br>
    He'd spurn the faith tomorrow, that was in him strong today:<br>
    For "someone told him something", and unto that he'd cling;<br>
    'Twas this mysterious "chap I met" who tells him every-thing.
  </p>

  <p>
    The latest always was the best — the very thing he sought —<br>
    Much better than "the rubbish" which my neighbour's curate bought;<br>
    'Twas fitted up with this and that — it was in short immense;<br>
    'Twould do sick-calls around the earth like falling off a fence.
  </p>

  <p>
    He talked and talked like one possessed as on the madness ran;<br>
    Such folly surely never gripped the mind of any man:<br>
    "Ignition this", "combustion that" — I never heard the likes,<br>
    You'd think the world was spinning round on works of motor-bikes.
  </p>

  <p>
    I took a stand as rectors should, and fussed and fumed and that,<br>
    And lavished pointed rhetoric and wisdom — on the cat;<br>
    But on he went from bad to worse: bedad, it shocked me much<br>
    To hear him speak of dignitaries as cylinders and such.
  </p>

  <p>
    The horsepower of the clergy, too, I heard him dwell upon, <br>
    And I'm "a last year's model", faith, "with no kick-starter<br>
    Still, he laughs best who laughs the last, when all is said and done,<br>
    For when the smelly thing arrived, 'twas then we had the fun.
  </p>

  <p>
    He donned the goggles arid the coat, the cap, the gloves, the scarf,<br>
    And pushed it to the stable-yard, supported by the staff<br>
    He jacked the wheel and kicked with fine spectacular disdain,<br>
    It gave a sort of wheezy cough, and so he kicked again.
  </p>

  <p>
    Still no result: then, undismayed, he played the second card:<br>
    He pushed it off the stand, he did, and wheeled it round the yard;<br>
    He wheeled it up, he wheeled it down, until he near expired,<br>
    He forced the groom to take a turn, but, faith, he soon got tired.
  </p>

  <p>
    The small lads gave him useful hints, he told them to be gone,<br>
    And when he chased them off the fence he turned the petrol on;<br>
    Then, man, he gave a thumping kick and swung into the seat,<br>
    And here my hero motor-man goes shooting down the Street.
  </p>

  <p>
    Along the king's highway he sped on what he calls "his top";<br>
    Upon his top: How are you! Heth, he found he couldn't stop;<br>
    His tank was full of "juice", it seems, and in his misery<br>
    He worked it out the wicked thing would wheel him to the sea.
  </p>

  <p>
    But through it all the mind was clear, he dodged the straying stock,<br>
    If tour he must, 'twere wise, he thought, to tour around the block:<br>
    So round and round and round he went, the eyes fixed straight ahead,<br>
    And every time at Mrs Flynn's the congregation spread,
  </p>

  <p>
    And every time he passed the house which Granny Heafy leased,<br>
    That pious person jerked the knee, respectful to the priest;<br>
    So round and round and round he went with bump and swerve and skid —<br>
    Of course he never told me this, but fifty people did.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now trouble's soon forgot, it seems, by all these motor-men;<br>
    I hoped he'd sell the wretched thing, but on he came again: <br>
    The front veranda corner there is like a tinker's shop;<br>
    Bad cess to it! I don't know where the thing is going to stop.
  </p>

  <p>
    He's made this house a meeting-place for faddists and the likes,<br>
    And clerical mechanics come debating motor-bikes;<br>
    They talk a man unconscious with their cranks and gears and springs,<br>
    And bore and stroke, and this and that, and sparkling-plugs and things.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now God be with the good old times for ever dead and gone,<br>
    When in this cheery room of mine I led the banter on;<br>
    For though we spoke of grave affairs, or touched the lighter side,<br>
    No man need sit and twirl his thumbs, because disqualified.
  </p>

  <p>
    Well, youth must have its fling, I ween, and face the future, still<br>
    The old grey horse and I shall jog together down the hill;<br>
    We've come a long, hard, weary way, nor shirked the bonded load,<br>
    We'll carry on and see it through, Old Comrade of the road.
  </p>

  <p>
    No, not for us the whirring wheel that greets the morning's call,<br>
    We only have "one speed", my boy, and that's no speed at all:<br>
    The evening finds us laid aside, and dreaming in the sun —<br>
    Two "last year's models" right enough, with engines nearly done.
  </p>

  <p>
    But tell them this: Ere roads were made, by bridle-track we went,<br>
    And won the bush with church and school across a con-tinent;<br>
    The journey's o'er; the chapter's writ; and take it how we like,<br>
    The big things now are waiting for the young man's motor-bike.
