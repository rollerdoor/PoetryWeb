  <p>
    Tall and freckled and sandy,<br>
    Face of a country lout;<br>
    This was the picture of Andy,<br>
    Middleton's Rouseabout.
  </p>

  <p>
    Type of a coming nation,<br>
    In the land of cattle and sheep,<br>
    Worked on Middleton's station,<br>
    `Pound a week and his keep.'
  </p>

  <p>
    On Middleton's wide dominions<br>
    Plied the stockwhip and shears;<br>
    Hadn't any opinions,<br>
    Hadn't any `idears'.
  </p>

  <p>
    Swiftly the years went over,<br>
    Liquor and drought prevailed;<br>
    Middleton went as a drover,<br>
    After his station had failed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Type of a careless nation,<br>
    Men who are soon played out,<br>
    Middleton was: â€” and his station<br>
    Was bought by the Rouseabout.
  </p>

  <p>
    Flourishing beard and sandy,<br>
    Tall and robust and stout;<br>
    This is the picture of Andy,<br>
    Middleton's Rouseabout.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now on his own dominions<br>
    Works with his overseers;<br>
    Hasn't any opinions,<br>
    Hasn't any `idears'.</p>
