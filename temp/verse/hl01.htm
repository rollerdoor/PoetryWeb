  <p>
    Our Andy's gone with cattle now -<br>
    Our hearts are out of order -<br>
    With drought he's gone to battle now<br>
    Across the Queensland border.</p>

  <p>He's left us in dejection now,<br>
    Our thoughts with him are roving;<br>
    It's dull on this selection now,<br>
    Since Andy went a-droving.</p>

  <p>Who now shall wear the cheerful face<br>
    In times when things are slackest?<br>
    And who shall whistle round the place<br>
    When Fortune frowns her blackest'?</p>

  <p>Oh, who shall cheek the squatter now<br>
    When he comes round us snarling?<br>
    His tongue is growing hotter now<br>
    Since Andy crossed the Darling.</p>

  <p>Oh, may the showers in torrents fall,<br>
    And all the tanks run over;<br>
    And may the grass grow green and tall<br>
    In pathways of the drover;</p>

  <p>And may good angels send the rain<br>
    On desert stretches sandy;<br>
    And when the summer comes again<br>
    God grant 'twill bring us Andy.</p>
