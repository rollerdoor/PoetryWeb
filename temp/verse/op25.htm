  <p>
    I was down the Riverina, knockin' 'round the towns a bit,<br>
    And occasionally resting with a schooner in me mitt,<br>
    And on one of these occasions, when the bar was pretty full<br>
    And the local blokes were arguin' assorted kind of bull,<br>
    I heard a conversation, most peculiar in its way.<br>
    It's only in Australia you would hear a joker say:
  </p>

  <p>
    "Howya bloody been, ya drongo, haven't seen ya fer a week,<br>
    And yer mate was lookin' for ya when ya come in from the creek.<br>
    'E was lookin' up at Ryan's, and around at bloody Joe's,<br>
    And even at the Royal, where 'e bloody NEVER goes".
  </p>

  <p>
    And the other bloke says "Seen 'im? Owed 'im half a bloody quid.<br>
    Forgot to give it back to him, but now I bloody did -<br>
    Could've used the thing me bloody self. Been off the bloody booze,<br>
    Up at Tumba-bloody-rumba shootin' kanga-bloody-roos."
  </p>

  <p>
    Now the bar was pretty quiet, and everybody heard<br>
    The peculiar integration of this adjectival word,<br>
    But no-one there was laughing, and me - I wasn't game,<br>
    So I just sits back and lets them think I spoke the bloody same.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then someone else was interested to know just what he got,<br>
    How many kanga-bloody-roos he went and bloody shot,<br>
    And the shooting bloke says "Things are crook -<br>
    the drought's too bloody tough.<br>
    I got forty-two by seven, and that's good e-bloody-nough."
  </p>

  <p>
    And, as this polite rejoinder seemed to satisfy the mob,<br>
    Everyone stopped listening and got on with the job,<br>
    Which was drinkin' beer, and arguin', and talkin' of the heat,<br>
    Of boggin' in the bitumen in the middle of the street,<br>
    But as for me, I'm here to say the interesting piece of news<br>
    Was Tumba-bloody-rumba shootin' kanga-bloody-roos.
