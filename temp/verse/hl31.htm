<div class="verse">
  <p>
    Down the street as I was
    drifting with the city's human tide,<br>
    Came a ghost, and for a moment walked in silence by my side —<br>
    Now my heart was hard and bitter, and a bitter spirit he,<br>
    So I felt no great aversion to his ghostly company.<br>
    Said the Shade: `At finer feelings let your lip in scorn be curled,<br>
    `Self and Pelf', my friend, has ever been the motto for the world.'
  </p>

  <p>
    And he said: `If you'd be happy, you must clip your fancy's wings,<br>
    Stretch your conscience at the edges to the size of earthly things;<br>
    Never fight another's battle, for a friend can never know<br>
    When he'll gladly fly for succour to the bosom of the foe.<br>
    At the power of truth and friendship let your lip in scorn be curled —<br>
    `Self and Pelf', my friend, remember, is the motto of the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    `Where Society is mighty, always truckle to her rule;<br>
    Never send an `i' undotted to the teacher of a school;<br>
    Only fight a wrong or falsehood when the crowd is at your back,<br>
    And, till Charity repay you, shut the purse, and let her pack;<br>
    At the fools who would do other let your lip in scorn be curled,<br>
    `Self and Pelf', my friend, remember, that's the motto of the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    `Ne'er assail the shaky ladders Fame has from her niches hung,<br>
    Lest unfriendly heels above you grind your fingers from the rung;<br>
    Or the fools who idle under, envious of your fair renown,<br>
    Heedless of the pain you suffer, do their worst to shake you down.<br>
    At the praise of men, or censure, let your lip in scorn be curled,<br>
    `Self and Pelf', my friend, remember, is the motto of the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    `Flowing founts of inspiration leave their sources parched and dry,<br>
    Scalding tears of indignation sear the hearts that beat too high;<br>
    Chilly waters thrown upon it drown the fire that's in the bard;<br>
    And the banter of the critic hurts his heart till it grows hard.<br>
    At the fame your muse may offer let your lip in scorn be curled,<br>
    `Self and Pelf', my friend, remember, that's the motto of the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    `Shun the fields of love, where lightly, to a low and mocking tune,<br>
    Strong and useful lives are ruined, and the broken hearts are strewn.<br>
    Not a farthing is the value of the honest love you hold;<br>
    Call it lust, and make it serve you! Set your heart on nought but gold.<br>
    At the bliss of purer passions let your lip in scorn be curled —<br>
    `Self and Pelf', my friend, shall ever be the motto of the world.'
  </p>

  <p>
    Then he ceased and looked intently in my face, and nearer drew;<br>
    But a sudden deep repugnance to his presence thrilled me through;<br>
    Then I saw his face was cruel, by the look that o'er it stole,<br>
    Then I felt his breath was poison, by the shuddering of my soul,<br>
    Then I guessed his purpose evil, by his lip in sneering curled,<br>
    And I knew he slandered mankind, by my knowledge of the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    But he vanished as a purer brighter presence gained my side —<br>
    `Heed him not! there's truth and friendship<br>
    in this wondrous world,' she cried,<br>
    And of those who cleave to virtue in their climbing for renown,<br>
    Only they who faint or falter from the height are shaken down.<br>
    At a cynic's baneful teaching let your lip in scorn be curled!<br>
    `Brotherhood and Love and Honour!' is the motto for the world.'
