  <p>
    The old year went, and the new returned, in the withering weeks of drought,<br>
    The cheque was spent that the shearer earned,<br>
    and the sheds were all cut out;<br>
    The publican's words were short and few,<br>
    and the publican's looks were black --<br>
    And the time had come, as the shearer knew, to carry his swag Out Back.
  </p>

  <p>
    For time means tucker, and tramp you must,<br>
    where the scrubs and plains are wide,<br>
    With seldom a track that a man can trust, or a mountain peak to guide;<br>
    All day long in the dust and heat -- when summer is on the track --<br>
    With stinted stomachs and blistered feet,<br>
    they carry their swags Out Back.
  </p>

  <p>
    He tramped away from the shanty there, when the days were long and hot,<br>
    With never a soul to know or care if he died on the track or not.<br>
    The poor of the city have friends in woe, no matter how much they lack,<br>
    But only God and the swagmen know how a poor man fares Out Back.
  </p>

  <p>
    He begged his way on the parched Paroo and the Warrego tracks once more,<br>
    And lived like a dog, as the swagmen do, till the Western stations shore;<br>
    But men were many, and sheds were full, for work in the town was slack --<br>
    The traveller never got hands in wool,<br>
    though he tramped for a year Out Back.
  </p>

  <p>
    In stifling noons when his back was wrung<br>
    by its load, and the air seemed dead,<br>
    And the water warmed in the bag that hung to his aching arm like lead,<br>
    Or in times of flood, when plains were seas,<br>
    and the scrubs were cold and black,<br>
    He ploughed in mud to his trembling knees, and paid for his sins Out Back.
  </p>

  <p>
    He blamed himself in the year `Too Late' --<br>
    in the heaviest hours of life --<br>
    'Twas little he dreamed that a shearing-mate had care of his home and wife;<br>
    There are times when wrongs from your kindred come,<br>
    and treacherous tongues attack --<br>
    When a man is better away from home, and dead to the world, Out Back.
  </p>

  <p>
    And dirty and careless and old he wore, as his lamp of hope grew dim;<br>
    He tramped for years till the swag he bore seemed part of himself to him.<br>
    As a bullock drags in the sandy ruts, he followed the dreary track,<br>
    With never a thought but to reach the huts when the sun went down Out Back.
  </p>

  <p>
    It chanced one day, when the north wind blew<br>
    in his face like a furnace-breath,<br>
    He left the track for a tank he knew -- 'twas a short-cut to his death;<br>
    For the bed of the tank was hard and dry, and crossed with many a crack,<br>
    And, oh! it's a terrible thing to die of thirst in the scrub Out Back.
  </p>

  <p>
    A drover came, but the fringe of law was eastward many a mile;<br>
    He never reported the thing he saw, for it was not worth his while.<br>
    The tanks are full and the grass is high in the mulga off the track,<br>
    Where the bleaching bones of a white man lie<br>
    by his mouldering swag Out Back.
  </p>

  <p>
    For time means tucker, and tramp they must,<br>
    where the plains and scrubs are wide,<br>
    With seldom a track that a man can trust, or a mountain peak to guide;<br>
    All day long in the flies and heat the men of the outside track<br>
    With stinted stomachs and blistered feet<br>
    must carry their swags Out Back.
