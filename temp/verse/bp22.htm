  <p>
    There's never a stone at the sleeper's head,<br>
    There's never a fence beside,<br>
    And the wandering stock on the grave may tread<br>
    Unnoticed and undenied;<br>
    But the smallest child on the Watershed<br>
    Can tell you how Gilbert died.
  </p>

  <p>
    For he rode at dusk with his comrade Dunn<br>
    To the hut at the Stockman's Ford;<br>
    In the waning light of the sinking sun<br>
    They peered with a fierce accord.<br>
    They were outlaws both - and on each man's head<br>
    Was a thousand pounds reward.
  </p>

  <p>
    They had taken toll of the country round,<br>
    And the troopers came behind<br>
    With a black that tracked like a human hound<br>
    In the scrub and the ranges blind:<br>
    He could run the trail where a white man's eye<br>
    No sign of a track could find.
  </p>

  <p>
    He had hunted them out of the One Tree Hill<br>
    And over the Old Man Plain,<br>
    But they wheeled their tracks with a wild beast's skill,<br>
    And they made for the range again;<br>
    Then away to the hut where their grandsire dwelt<br>
    They rode with a loosened rein.
  </p>

  <p>
    And their grandsire gave them a greeting bold:<br>
    "Come in and rest in peace,<br>
    No safer place does the country hold -<br>
    With the night pursuiit must cease,<br>
    And we'll drink success to the roving boys,<br>
    And to hell with the black police."
  </p>

  <p>
    But they went to death when they entered there<br>
    In the hut at the Stockman's Ford,<br>
    For their grandsire's words were as false as fair -<br>
    They were doomed to the hangman's cord.<br>
    He had sold them both to the black police<br>
    For the sake of the big reward.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the depth of night there are forms that glide<br>
    As stealthy as serpents creep,<br>
    And around the hut where the outlaws hide<br>
    They plant in the shadows deep,<br>
    And they wait till the first faint Hush of dawn<br>
    Shall waken their prey from sleep.
  </p>

  <p>
    But Gilbert wakes while the night is dark -<br>
    A restless sleeper aye,<br>
    He has heard the sound of a sheep-dog's bark,<br>
    And his horse's warning neigh,<br>
    And he says to his mate, "There are hawks abroad,<br>
    And it's time we went away."
  </p>

  <p>
    Their rifles stood at the stretcher head,<br>
    Their bridles lay to hand;<br>
    They wakened the old man out of his bed,<br>
    When they heard the sharp command:<br>
    "In the name of the Queen lay down your arms,<br>
    Now, Dunn and Gilbert, stand!"
  </p>

  <p>
    Then Gilbert
    reached for his rifle true<br>
    That close at hand he kept;<br>
    He pointed straight at the voice, and drew,<br>
    But never a flash outleapt,<br>
    For the water ran from the rifle breech -<br>
    It was drenched while the outlaws, slept.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then he dropped the piece with a bitter oath,<br>
    And he turned to his comrade Dunn:<br>
    "We are sold," he said, "we are dead men both,<br>
    But there may be a chance for one;<br>
    I'll stop and I'll fight with the pistol here,<br>
    You take to your heels and run."
  </p>

  <p>
    So Dunn crept out on his hands and knees<br>
    In the dim, half-dawning light,<br>
    And he made his way to a patch of trees,<br>
    And was lost in the black of night;<br>
    And the trackers hunted his tracks all day,<br>
    But they never could trace his flight.
  </p>

  <p>
    But Gilbert walked from the open door<br>
    In a confident style, and rash;<br>
    He heard at his side the rifles roar,<br>
    And he heard the bullets crash.<br>
    But he laughed as he lifted his pistol-hand,<br>
    And he fired at the rifle Rash.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then out of the shadows the troopers aimed<br>
    At his voice and the pistol sound.<br>
    With rifle flashes the darkness flamed -<br>
    He staggered and spun around,<br>
    And they riddled his body with rifle balls<br>
    As it lay on the blood-soaked ground.
  </p>

  <p>
    There's never a stone at the sleeper's head,<br>
    There's never a fence beside,<br>
    And the wandering stock on the grave may tread<br>
    Unnoticed and undenied;<br>
    But the smallest child on the Watershed<br>
    Can tell you how Gilbert died.
