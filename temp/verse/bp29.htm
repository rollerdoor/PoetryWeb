  <p>
    Come all you little rouseabouts and climb upon my knee;<br>
    To-day, you see, is Christmas Day, and so it's up to me<br>
    To give you some instruction like -- a kind of Christmas tale --<br>
    So name your yarn, and off she goes. What, "Jonah and the Whale"?
  </p>

  <p>
    Well, whales is sheep I've never shore; I've never been to sea,<br>
    So all them great Leviathans is mysteries to me;<br>
    But there's a tale the Bible tells I fully understand,<br>
    About the time the Patriarchs were settling on the land.
  </p>

  <p>
    Those Patriarchs of olden time, when all is said and done,<br>
    They lived the same as far-out men on many a Queensland run --<br>
    A lot of roving, droving men who drifted to and fro,<br>
    The same we did out Queensland way a score of years ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now Isaac was a squatter man, and Jacob was his son,<br>
    And when the boy grew up, you see, he wearied of the run.<br>
    You know the way that boys grow up -- there's some that stick at home;<br>
    But any boy that's worth his salt will roll his swag and roam.
  </p>

  <p>
    So Jacob caught the roving fit and took the drovers' track<br>
    To where his uncle had a run, beyond the outer back;<br>
    You see they made for out-back runs for room to stretch and grow,<br>
    The same we did out Queensland way, a score of years ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, Jacob knew the ways of stock -- that's most uncommon clear --<br>
    For when he got to Laban's Run, they made him overseer;<br>
    He didn't ask a pound a week, but bargained for his pay<br>
    To take the roan and strawberry calves -- the same we'd take to-day.
  </p>

  <p>
    The duns and blacks and "Goulburn roans" (that's brindles), coarse and hard,<br>
    He branded them with Laban's brand, in Old Man Laban's yard;<br>
    So, when he'd done the station work for close on seven year,<br>
    Why, all the choicest stock belonged to Laban's overseer.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's often so with overseers -- I've seen the same thing done<br>
    By many a Queensland overseer on many a Queensland run.<br>
    But when the mustering time came on old Laban acted straight,<br>
    And gave him country of his own outside the boundary gate.
  </p>

  <p>
    He gave him stock, and offered him his daughter's hand in troth;<br>
    And Jacob first he married one, and then he married both;<br>
    You see, they weren't particular about a wife or so --<br>
    No more were we up Queensland way a score of years ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    But when the stock were strong and fat with grass and lots of rain,<br>
    Then Jacob felt the call to take the homeward road again.<br>
    It's strange in every creed and clime, no matter where you roam,<br>
    There comes a day when every man would like to make for home.
  </p>

  <p>
    So off he set with sheep and goats, a mighty moving band,<br>
    To battle down the homeward track along the Overland --<br>
    It's droving mixed-up mobs like that that makes men cut their throats.<br>
    I've travelled rams, which Lord forget, but never travelled goats.
  </p>

  <p>
    But Jacob knew the ways of stock, for (so the story goes)<br>
    When battling through the Philistines -- selectors, I suppose --<br>
    He thought he'd have to fight his way, an awkward sort of job;<br>
    So what did Old Man Jacob do? of course, he split the mob.
  </p>

  <p>
    He sent the strong stock on ahead to battle out the way;<br>
    He couldn't hurry lambing ewes -- no more you could to-day --<br>
    And down the road, from run to run, his hand 'gainst every hand,<br>
    He moved that mighty mob of stock across the Overland.
  </p>

  <p>
    The thing is made so clear and plain, so solid in and out,<br>
    There isn't any room at all for any kind of doubt.<br>
    It's just a plain straightforward tale -- a tale that lets you know<br>
    The way they lived in Palestine three thousand years ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's strange to read it all to-day, the shifting of the stock;<br>
    You'd think you see the caravans that loaf behind the flock,<br>
    The little donkeys and the mules, the sheep that slowly spread,<br>
    And maybe Dan or Naphthali a-ridin' on ahead.
  </p>

  <p>
    The long, dry, dusty summer days, the smouldering fires at night;<br>
    The stir and bustle of the camp at break of morning light;<br>
    The little kids that skipped about, the camels' dead-slow tramp --<br>
    I wish I'd done a week or two in Old Man Jacob's camp!
  </p>

  <p>
    But if I keep the narrer path, some day, perhaps, I'll know<br>
    How Jacob bred them strawberry calves three thousand years ago.
