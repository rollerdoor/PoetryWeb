  <p>
    I met her on the Lachlan Side â€“<br>
    A darling girl I thought her,<br>
    And ere I left I swore I'd win<br>
    The free-selector's daughter.
  </p>

  <p>
    I milked her father's cows a month,<br>
    I brought the wood and water,<br>
    I mended all the broken fence,<br>
    Before I won the daughter.
  </p>

  <p>
    I listened to her father's yarns,<br>
    I did just what I `oughter',<br>
    And what you'll have to do to win<br>
    A free-selector's daughter.
  </p>

  <p>
    I broke my pipe and burnt my twist,<br>
    And washed my mouth with water;<br>
    I had a shave before I kissed<br>
    The free-selector's daughter.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then, rising in the frosty morn,<br>
    I brought the cows for Mary,<br>
    And when I'd milked a bucketful<br>
    I took it to the dairy.
  </p>

  <p>
    I poured the milk into the dish<br>
    While Mary held the strainer,<br>
    I summoned heart to speak my wish,<br>
    And, oh! her blush grew plainer.
  </p>

  <p>
    I told her I must leave the place,<br>
    I said that I would miss her;<br>
    At first she turned away her face,<br>
    And then she let me kiss her.
  </p>

  <p>
    I put the bucket on the ground,<br>
    And in my arms I caught her:<br>
    I'd give the world to hold again<br>
    That free-selector's daughter!
