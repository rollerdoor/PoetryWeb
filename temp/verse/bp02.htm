        I had written him a letter which I had, for want of better <br>
        Knowledge, sent to where I met him down the Lachlan, years ago,<br>
        He was shearing when I knew him, so I sent the letter to him,<br>
        Just `on spec', addressed as follows, `Clancy, of The Overflow'.
    </p>

    <p>
        And an answer came directed in a writing unexpected,<br>
        (And I think the same was written with a thumb-nail dipped in tar)<br>
        'Twas his shearing mate who wrote it, and verbatim I will quote it:<br>
        `Clancy's gone to Queensland droving, and we don't know where he are.'
    </p>

    <p>
        In my wild erratic fancy visions come to me of Clancy<br>
        Gone a-droving `down the Cooper' where the Western drovers go;<br>
        As the stock are slowly stringing, Clancy rides behind them singing,<br>
        For the drover's life has pleasures that the townsfolk never know.
    </p>

    <p>
        And the bush hath friends to meet him, and their kindly voices greet him<br>
        In the murmur of the breezes and the river on its bars,<br>
        And he sees the vision splendid of the sunlit plains extended,<br>
        And at night the wond'rous glory of the everlasting stars.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am sitting in my dingy little office, where a stingy<br>
        Ray of sunlight struggles feebly down between the houses tall,<br>
        And the foetid air and gritty of the dusty, dirty city<br>
        Through the open window floating, spreads its foulness over all
    </p>

    <p>
        And in place of lowing cattle, I can hear the fiendish rattle<br>
        Of the tramways and the 'buses making hurry down the street,<br>
        And the language uninviting of the gutter children fighting,<br>
        Comes fitfully and faintly through the ceaseless tramp of feet.
    </p>

    <p>
        And the hurrying people daunt me, and their pallid faces haunt me<br>
        As they shoulder one another in their rush and nervous haste,<br>
        With their eager eyes and greedy, and their stunted forms and weedy,<br>
        For townsfolk have no time to grow, they have no time to waste.
    </p>

    <p>
        And I somehow rather fancy that I'd like to change with Clancy,<br>
        Like to take a turn at droving where the seasons come and go,<br>
        While he faced the round eternal of the cash-book and the journal --<br>
        But I doubt he'd suit the office, Clancy, of `The Overflow'.
