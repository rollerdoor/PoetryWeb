<div class="verse">
  <p>
    On Western plains, where shade is not,<br>
    'Neath summer skies of cloudless blue,<br>
    Where all is dry and all is hot,<br>
    There stands the town of Dandaloo --<br>
    A township where life's total sum<br>
    Is sleep, diversified with rum.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's grass-grown streets with dust are deep,<br>
    'Twere vain endeavour to express<br>
    The dreamless silence of its sleep,<br>
    Its wide, expansive drunkenness.<br>
    The yearly races mostly drew<br>
    A lively crowd to Dandaloo.
  </p>

  <p>
    There came a sportsman from the East,<br>
    The eastern land where sportsmen blow,<br>
    And brought with him a speedy beast --<br>
    A speedy beast as horses go.<br>
    He came afar in hope to `do'<br>
    The little town of Dandaloo.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now this was weak of him, I wot --<br>
    Exceeding weak, it seemed to me --<br>
    For we in Dandaloo were not<br>
    The Jugginses we seemed to be;<br>
    In fact, we rather thought we knew<br>
    Our book by heart in Dandaloo.
  </p>

  <p>
    We held a meeting at the bar,<br>
    And met the question fair and square --<br>
    `We've stumped the country near and far<br>
    To raise the cash for races here;<br>
    We've got a hundred pounds or two --<br>
    Not half so bad for Dandaloo.
  </p>

  <p>
    `And now, it seems, we have to be<br>
    Cleaned out by this here Sydney bloke,<br>
    With his imported horse; and he<br>
    Will scoop the pool and leave us broke<br>
    Shall we sit still, and make no fuss<br>
    While this chap climbs all over us?'
  </p>

  <p>
    The races came to Dandaloo,<br>
    And all the cornstalks from the West,<br>
    On ev'ry kind of moke and screw,<br>
    Came forth in all their glory drest.<br>
    The stranger's horse, as hard as nails,<br>
    Look'd fit to run for New South Wales.
  </p>

  <p>
    He won the race by half a length --<br>
    QUITE half a length, it seemed to me --<br>
    But Dandaloo, with all its strength,<br>
    Roared out `Dead heat!' most fervently;<br>
    And, after hesitation meet,<br>
    The judge's verdict was `Dead heat!'
  </p>

  <p>
    And many men there were could tell<br>
    What gave the verdict extra force:<br>
    The stewards, and the judge as well --<br>
    They all had backed the second horse.<br>
    For things like this they sometimes do<br>
    In larger towns than Dandaloo.
  </p>

  <p>
    They ran it off; the stranger won,<br>
    Hands down, by near a hundred yards<br>
    He smiled to think his troubles done;<br>
    But Dandaloo held all the cards.<br>
    They went to scale and -- cruel fate! --<br>
    His jockey turned out under-weight.
  </p>

  <p>
    Perhaps they'd tampered with the scale!<br>
    I cannot tell. I only know<br>
    It weighed him OUT all right. I fail<br>
    To paint that Sydney sportsman's woe.<br>
    He said the stewards were a crew<br>
    Of low-lived thieves in Dandaloo.
  </p>

  <p>
    He lifted up his voice, irate,<br>
    And swore till all the air was blue;<br>
    So then we rose to vindicate<br>
    The dignity of Dandaloo.<br>
    `Look here,' said we, `you must not poke<br>
    Such oaths at us poor country folk.'
  </p>

  <p>
    We rode him softly on a rail,<br>
    We shied at him, in careless glee,<br>
    Some large tomatoes, rank and stale,<br>
    And eggs of great antiquity --<br>
    Their wild, unholy fragrance flew<br>
    About the town of Dandaloo.
  </p>

  <p>
    He left the town at break of day,<br>
    He led his race-horse through the streets,<br>
    And now he tells the tale, they say,<br>
    To every racing man he meets.<br>
    And Sydney sportsmen all eschew<br>
    The atmosphere of Dandaloo.
