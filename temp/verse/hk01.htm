  <p>
    By channels of coolness the echoes are calling,<br>
    And down the dim gorges I hear the creek falling;<br>
    It lives in the mountain, where moss and the sedges<br>
    Touch with their beauty the banks and the ledges;<br>
    Through brakes of the cedar and sycamore bowers<br>
    Struggles the light that is love to the flowers.<br>
    And, softer than slumber, and sweeter than singing,<br>
    The notes of the bell-birds are running and ringing.
  </p>

  <p>
    The silver-voiced bell-birds, the darlings of day-time,<br>
    They sing in September their songs of the May-time.<br>
    When shadows wax strong and the thunder-bolts hurtle,<br>
    They hide with their fear in the leaves of the myrtle;<br>
    When rain and the sunbeams shine mingled together<br>
    They start up like fairies that follow fair weather,<br>
    And straightway the hues of their feathers unfolden<br>
    Are the green and the purple, the blue and the golden.
  </p>

    October, the maiden of bright yellow tresses,<br>
    Loiters for love in these cool wildernesses;<br>
    Loiters knee-deep in the grasses to listen,<br>
    Where dripping rocks gleam and the leafy pools glisten.<br>
    Then is the time when the water-moons splendid<br>
    Break with their gold, and are scattered or blended<br>
    Over the creeks, till the woodlands have warning<br>
    Of songs of the bell-bird and wings of the morning.
  </p>

  <p>
    Welcome as waters unkissed by the summers<br>
    Are the voices of bell-birds to thirsty far-comers.<br>
    When fiery December sets foot in the forest,<br>
    And the need of the wayfarer presses the sorest,<br>
    Pent in the ridges for ever and ever.<br>
    The bell-birds direct him to spring and to river,<br>
    With ring and with ripple, like runnels whose torrents<br>
    Are toned by the pebbles and leaves in the currents.
  </p>

  <p>
    Often I sit, looking back to a childhood<br>
    Mixt with the sights and the sounds of the wildwood,<br>
    Longing for power and the sweetness to fashion<br>
    Lyrics with beats like the heart-beats of passion --<br>
    Songs interwoven of lights and of laughters<br>
    Borrowed from bell-birds in far forest rafters;<br>
    So I might keep in the city and alleys<br>
    The beauty and strength of the deep mountain valleys,<br>
    Charming to slumber the pain of my losses<br>
    With glimpses of creeks and a vision of mosses.
