    He crouches, and buries his face on his knees,<br>
    And hides in the dark of his hair;<br>
    For he cannot look up to the storm-smitten trees,<br>
    Or think of the loneliness there --<br>
    Of the loss and the loneliness there.
  </p>

  <p>
    The wallaroos grope through the tufts of the grass,<br>
    And turn to their coverts for fear;<br>
    But he sits in the ashes and lets them pass<br>
    Where the boomerangs sleep with the spear --<br>
    With the nullah, the sling and the spear.
  </p>

  <p>
    Uloola, behold him! The thunder that breaks<br>
    On the tops of the rocks with the rain,<br>
    And the wind which drives up with the salt of the lakes,<br>
    Have made him a hunter again --<br>
    A hunter and fisher again.
  </p>

  <p>
    For his eyes have been
    full with a smouldering thought;<br>
    But he dreams of the hunts of yore,<br>
    And of foes that he sought, and of fights that he fought<br>
    With those who will battle no more --<br>
    Who will go to the battle no more.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is well that the water
    which tumbles and fills,<br>
    Goes moaning and moaning along;<br>
    For an echo rolls out from the sides of the hills,<br>
    And he starts at a wonderful song --<br>
    At the sound of a wonderful song.
  </p>

  <p>
    And he sees, through the
    rents of the scattering fogs,<br>
    The corroboree warlike and grim,<br>
    And the lubra who sat by the fire on the logs,<br>
    To watch, like a mourner, for him --<br>
    Like a mother and mourner for him.
  </p>

  <p>
    Will he go in his sleep
    from these desolate lands,<br>
    Like a chief, to the rest of his race,<br>
    With the honey-voiced woman who beckons and stands,<br>
    And gleams like a dream in his face --<br>
    Like a marvellous dream in his face?
