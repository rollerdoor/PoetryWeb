  <p>
    The ocean heaves around us still<br>
    With long and measured swell,<br>
    The autumn gales our canvas fill,<br>
    Our ship rides smooth and well.<br>
    The broad Atlantic's bed of foam<br>
    Still breaks against our prow;<br>
    I shed no tears at quitting home,<br>
    Nor will I shed them now!
  </p>

  <p>
    Against the bulwarks on the poop<br>
    I lean, and watch the sun<br>
    Behind the red horizon stoop —<br>
    His race is nearly run.<br>
    Those waves will never quench his light,<br>
    O'er which they seem to close,<br>
    To-morrow he will rise as bright<br>
    As he this morning rose.
  </p>

  <p>
    How brightly gleams the orb of day<br>
    Across the trackless sea!<br>
    How lightly dance the waves that play<br>
    Like dolphins in our lee!<br>
    The restless waters seem to say,<br>
    In smothered tones to me,<br>
    How many thousand miles away<br>
    My native land must be!
  </p>

  <p>
    Speak, Ocean! is my Home the same<br>
    Now all is new to me? —<br>
    The tropic sky's resplendent flame,<br>
    The vast expanse of sea?<br>
    Does all around her, yet unchanged,<br>
    The well-known aspect wear?<br>
    Oh! can the leagues that I have ranged<br>
    Have made no difference there?
  </p>

  <p>
    How vivid Recollection's hand<br>
    Recalls the scene once more!<br>
    I see the same tall poplars stand<br>
    Beside the garden door;<br>
    I see the bird-cage hanging still;<br>
    And where my sister set<br>
    The flowers in the window-sill —<br>
    Can they be living yet?
  </p>

  <p>
    Let woman's nature cherish grief,<br>
    I rarely heave a sigh<br>
    Before emotion takes relief<br>
    In listless apathy;<br>
    While from my pipe the vapours curl<br>
    Towards the evening sky,<br>
    And 'neath my feet the billows whirl<br>
    In dull monotony!
  </p>

  <p>
    The sky still wears the crimson streak<br>
    Of Sol's departing ray,<br>
    Some briny drops are on my cheek,<br>
    'Tis but the salt sea spray!<br>
    Then let our barque the ocean roam,<br>
    Our keel the billows plough;<br>
    I shed no tears at quitting home,<br>
    Nor will I shed them now!
