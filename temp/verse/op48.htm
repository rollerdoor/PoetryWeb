  <p>
    After the whey-faced anonymity<br>
    Of river-gums and scribbly-gums and bush,<br>
    After the rubbing and the hit of brush,<br>
    You come to the South Country
  </p>

  <p>
    As if the argument of trees were done,<br>
    The doubts and quarrelling, the plots and pains,<br>
    All ended by these clear and gliding planes<br>
    Like an abrupt solution.
  </p>

  <p>
    And over the flat earth of empty farms<br>
    The monstrous continent of air floats back<br>
    Coloured with rotting sunlight and the black,<br>
    Bruised flesh of thunderstorms:
  </p>

  <p>
    Air arched, enormous, pounding the bony ridge,<br>
    Ditches and hutches, with a drench of light,<br>
    So huge, from such infinities of height,<br>
    You walk on the sky's beach
  </p>

  <p>
    While even the dwindled hills are small and bare,<br>
    As if, rebellious, buried, pitiful,<br>
    Something below pushed up a knob of skull,<br>
    Feeling its way to air.
  </p>
