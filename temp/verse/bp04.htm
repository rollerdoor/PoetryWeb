    <p>
        Now look, you see, it's this way like,<br>
        You cross the broken bridge<br>
        And run the crick down till you strike<br>
        The second right-hand ridge.
    </p>

    <p>
        The track is hard to see in parts,<br>
        But still it's pretty clear;<br>
        There's been two Injin hawkers' carts<br>
        Along that road this year.
    </p>

    <p>
        Well, run that right-hand ridge along --<br>
        It ain't, to say, too steep --<br>
        There's two fresh tracks might put you wrong<br>
        Where blokes went out with sheep.
    </p>

    <p>
        But keep the crick upon your right,<br>
        And follow pretty straight<br>
        Along the spur, until you sight<br>
        A wire and sapling gate.
    </p>

    <p>
        Well, that's where Hogan's old grey mare<br>
        Fell off and broke her back;<br>
        You'll see her carcase layin' there,<br>
        Jist down below the track.
    </p>

    <p>
        And then you drop two mile, or three,<br>
        It's pretty steep and blind;<br>
        You want to go and fall a tree<br>
        And tie it on behind.
    </p>

    <p>
        And then you pass a broken cart<br>
        Below a granite bluff;<br>
        And that is where you strike the part<br>
        They reckon pretty rough.
    </p>

    <p>
        But by the time you've got that far<br>
        It's either cure or kill,<br>
        So turn your horses round the spur<br>
        And face 'em up the hill.
    </p>

    <p>
        For look, if you should miss the slope<br>
        And get below the track,<br>
        You haven't got the whitest hope<br>
        Of ever gettin' back.
    </p>

    <p>
        An' half way up you'll see the hide<br>
        Of Hogan's brindled bull;<br>
        Well, mind and keep the right-hand side,<br>
        The left's too steep a pull.
    </p>

    <p>
        And both the banks is full of cracks;<br>
        An' just about at dark<br>
        You'll see the last year's bullock tracks<br>
        Where Hogan drew the bark.
    </p>

    <p>
        The marks is old and pretty faint<br>
        And grown with scrub and such;<br>
        Of course the track to Hogan's ain't<br>
        A road that's travelled much.
    </p>

    <p>
        But turn and run the tracks along<br>
        For half a mile or more,<br>
        And then, of course, you can't go wrong --<br>
        You're right at Hogan's door.
    </p>

    <p>
        When first you come to Hogan's gate<br>
        He mightn't show, perhaps;<br>
        He's pretty sure to plant and wait<br>
        To see it ain't the traps.
    </p>

    <p>
        I wouldn't call it good enough<br>
        To let your horses out;<br>
        There's some that's pretty extra rough<br>
        Is livin' round about.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's likely if your horses did<br>
        Get feedin' near the track,<br>
        It's goin' to cost at least a quid<br>
        Or more to get them back.
    </p>

    <p>
        So, if you find they're off the place,<br>
        It's up to you to go<br>
        And flash a quid in Hogan's face --<br>
        He'll know the blokes that know.
    </p>

    <p>
        But listen, if you're feelin' dry,<br>
        Just see there's no one near,<br>
        And go and wink the other eye<br>
        And ask for ginger beer.
    </p>

    <p>
        The blokes come in from near and far<br>
        To sample Hogan's pop;<br>
        They reckon once they breast the bar<br>
        They stay there till they drop.
    </p>

    <p>
        On Sundays you can see them spread<br>
        Like flies around the tap.<br>
        It's like that song "The Livin' Dead"<br>
        Up there at Hogan's Gap.
    </p>

    <p>
        They like to make it pretty strong<br>
        Whenever there's a charnce;<br>
        So when a stranger comes along<br>
        They always holds a darnce.
    </p>

    <p>
        There's recitations, songs, and fights --<br>
        A willin' lot you'll meet.<br>
        There's one long bloke up there recites,<br>
        I tell you -- he's a treat.
    </p>

    <p>
        They're lively blokes all right up there,<br>
        It's never dull a day.<br>
        I'd go meself if I could spare<br>
        The time to get away.
    </p>

    <p>*****</p>

    <p>
        The stranger turned his horses quick.<br>
        He didn't cross the bridge;<br>
        He didn't go along the crick<br>
        To strike the second ridge;
    </p>

    <p>
        He didn't make the trip, because<br>
        He wasn't feeling fit.<br>
        His business up at Hogan's was<br>
        To serve him with a writ.
    </p>

    <p>
        He reckoned if he faced the pull<br>
        And climbed the rocky stair,<br>
        The next to come might find his hide<br>
        A land-mark on the mountain side,<br>
        Along with Hogan's brindled bull<br>
        And Hogan's old grey mare!
        <br>
