  <p>
    Come all Australian sons with me<br>
    For a hero has been slain<br>
    And cowardly butchered in his sleep<br>
    Upon the Lachlan Plain.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pray do not stay your seemly grief<br>
    But let a teardrop fall<br>
    For many hearts shall always mourn<br>
    The fate of bold Ben Hall.
  </p>

  <p>
    No brand of Cain e'er stamped his brow,<br>
    No widow's curse did fall;<br>
    When tales are read the squatters dread<br>
    The name of bold Ben Hall.
  </p>

  <p>
    The records of this hero bold<br>
    Through Europe have been heard,<br>
    And formed a conversation<br>
    Between many an Earl and Lord.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ever since the good old days<br>
    Of Dick Turpin and Duval,<br>
    Knights of the road were outlaws bold,<br>
    And so was bold Ben Hall.
  </p>

  <p>
    He never robbed a needy man,<br>
    His records best will show,<br>
    Staunch and loyal to his mates,<br>
    And manly to the foe.
  </p>

  <p>
    Until he left his trusty mates,<br>
    The cause I ne'er could hear,<br>
    The bloodhounds of the law heard this<br>
    And after him did steer.
  </p>

  <p>
    They found his place of ambush,<br>
    And cautiously they crept,<br>
    And savagely they murdered him<br>
    While the victim slept.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yes, savagely they murdered him,<br>
    The cowardly blue-coat imps,<br>
    Who were laid onto where he slept<br>
    By informing peelers' pimps.
  </p>

  <p>
    No more he'll mount his gallant steed,<br>
    Nor range the mountains high,<br>
    The widow's friend in poverty â€”<br>
    Bold Ben Hall, good-bye.
  </p>
