<div class="verse">
  <p>
    Grey Winter hath gone, like a wearisome guest,<br>
    And, behold, for repayment,<br>
    September comes in with the wind of the West<br>
    And the Spring in her raiment!<br>
    The ways of the frost have been filled of the flowers,<br>
    While the forest discovers<br>
    Wild wings, with the halo of hyaline hours,<br>
    And the music of lovers.
  </p>

  <p>
    September, the maid with the swift, silver feet!<br>
    She glides, and she graces<br>
    The valleys of coolness, the slopes of the heat,<br>
    With her blossomy traces;<br>
    Sweet month, with a mouth that is made of a rose,<br>
    She lightens and lingers<br>
    In spots where the harp of the evening glows,<br>
    Attuned by her fingers.
  </p>

  <p>
    The stream from its home in the hollow hill slips<br>
    In a darling old fashion;<br>
    And the day goeth down with a song on its lips<br>
    Whose key-note is passion;<br>
    Far out in the fierce, bitter front of the sea<br>
    I stand, and remember<br>
    Dead things that were brothers and sisters of thee,<br>
    Resplendent September.
  </p>

  <p>
    The West, when it blows at the fall of the noon<br>
    And beats on the beaches,<br>
    Is filled with a tender and tremulous tune<br>
    That touches and teaches;<br>
    The stories of Youth, of the burden of Time,<br>
    And the death of Devotion,<br>
    Come back with the wind, and are themes of the rhyme<br>
    In the waves of the ocean.
  </p>

  <p>
    We, having a secret to others unknown,<br>
    In the cool mountain-mosses,<br>
    May whisper together, September, alone<br>
    Of our loves and our losses.<br>
    One word for her beauty, and one for the grace<br>
    She gave to the hours;<br>
    And then we may kiss her, and suffer her face<br>
    To sleep with the flowers.
  </p>

  <p>*****</p>

  <p>
    Oh, season of changes -- of shadow and shine --<br>
    September the splendid!<br>
    My song hath no music to mingle with thine,<br>
    And its burden is ended;<br>
    But thou, being born of the winds and the sun,<br>
    By mountain, by river,<br>
    Mayst lighten and listen, and loiter and run,<br>
    With thy voices for ever.
  </p>
