    We learnt the creed at Hungerford,<br>
    We learnt the creed at Bourke;<br>
    We learnt it in the good times<br>
    And learnt it out of work.<br>
    We learnt it by the harbour-side<br>
    And on the billabong:<br>
    "No matter what a mate may do,<br>
    A mate can do no wrong!"
  </p>

  <p>
    He's like a king in this respect<br>
    (No matter what they do),<br>
    And, king-like, shares in storm and shine<br>
    The Throne of Life with you.<br>
    We learnt it when we were in gaol <br>
    And put it in a song:<br>
    " No matter what a mate may do,<br>
    A mate can do no wrong!"
  </p>

  <p>
    They'll say he said a bitter word<br>
    When he's away or dead.<br>
    We're loyal to his memory,<br>
    No matter what he said.<br>
    And we should never hesitate,<br>
    But strike out good and strong,<br>
    And jolt the slanderer on the jaw â€“<br>
    A mate can do no wrong !
