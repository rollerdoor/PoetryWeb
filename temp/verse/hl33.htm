<div class="verse">
  <p>
    On a lonely selection far out in the West<br>
    An old woman works all the day without rest,<br>
    And she croons, as she toils 'neath the sky's glassy dome,<br>
    `Sure I'll keep the ould place till the childer come home.'
  </p>

  <p>
    She mends all the fences, she grubs, and she ploughs,<br>
    She drives the old horse and she milks all the cows,<br>
    And she sings to herself as she thatches the stack,<br>
    `Sure I'll keep the ould place till the childer come back.'
  </p>

  <p>
    It is five weary years since her old husband died;<br>
    And oft as he lay on his deathbed he sighed<br>
    `Sure one man can bring up ten children, he can,<br>
    An' it's strange that ten sons cannot keep one old man.'
  </p>

  <p>
    Whenever the scowling old sundowners come,<br>
    And cunningly ask if the master's at home,<br>
    `Be off,' she replies, `with your blarney and cant,<br>
    Or I'll call my son Andy; he's workin' beyant.'
  </p>

  <p>
    `Git out,' she replies, though she trembles with fear,<br>
    For she lives all alone and no neighbours are near;<br>
    But she says to herself, when she's like to despond,<br>
    That the boys are at work in the paddock beyond.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ah, none of her children need follow the plough,<br>
    And some have grown rich in the city ere now;<br>
    Yet she says: `They might come when the shearing is done,<br>
    And I'll keep the ould place if it's only for one.'
  </p>
