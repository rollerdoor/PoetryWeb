<div class="verse">
  <p>
    He was driving Irish tandem, but perhaps I talk at random '<br>
    I'd forgotten for a moment you are not all mulga bred;<br>
    What I mean's he had his swag up through his having knocked his nag up;<br>
    He had come in off the Cooper ' anyhow that's what he said.
  </p>

  <p>And he looked as full of knowledge as a thirty-acre college<br>
    As he answered to the question ' 'How's things look the way you come?'<br>
    'Well, they <span class="ital">were</span> a trifle willing for a bit. There's been some killing; In fact,<br>
    I'm the sole survivor of the district... mine's a rum!'
  </p>

  <p>
    Then we all got interested in the chap as he divested<br>
    Himself of a fat puppy that he carried in his shirt;<br>
    But he said no more until he had put down his swag and billy,<br>
    And had taken off his bluchers just to empty out the dirt.
  </p>

  <p>
    Bits of cork were tied with laces round his hat in many places,<br>
    Out of which he gave the puppy some refreshment, and began '<br>
    'Sammy Suds was boundary-riding, quite content and law-abiding,<br>
    Till he bought some reading-matter one day off a hawker man.
  </p>

  <p>
    'Then he started to go ratty, and began to fancy that he<br>
    Was an Injun on the warpath; so he plaited a lassoo,<br>
    Shaved and smeared his face with raddle, and knocked up a greenhide saddle,<br>
    After creeping on his belly through the grass a mile or two.
  </p>

  <p>
    'Then he decked himself in feathers, and went out and scalped some wethers '<br>
    Just to give himself a lesson in the sanguinary art;<br>
    Sammy then dug up the hatchet, chased a snake but couldn't catch it,<br>
    Killed his dog, lassooed a turkey, scalped the cat and made a start.
  </p>

  <p>
    'And he caused a great sensation when he landed at the station;<br>
    And the boss said, 'Hullo! Sammy, what the devil's up with you?'<br>
    'I am Slimy Snake the Snorter! Wretched pale-face, crave not quarter!'<br>
    He replied, and with a shot-gun nearly blew the boss in two.
  </p>

  <p>
    'Next, the wood-and-water joey fell a victim to his bowie,<br>
    And the boss's weeping widow got a gash from ear to ear;<br>
    And you should have seen his guiver when he scalped the bullock-driver<br>
    And made openings for a horse-boy, servant-maid, and overseer.
  </p>

  <p>
    'Counting jackeroos and niggers, he had put up double figures,<br>
    When ensued his awful combat with a party of new-chums,<br>
    All agog to do their duty, with no thought of home or beauty '<br>
    But he rubbed them out as rapid as a schoolboy would his sums.
  </p>

  <p>
    'Out across the silent river, with some duck-shot in his liver,<br>
    Went the store-man, and a lassooed lady left in the same boat.<br>
    Sam then solved the Chinese question ' or at least made a suggestion '<br>
    For he dragged one from a barrel by the tail and cut his throat.
  </p>

  <p>
    "But, with thus the job completed, Sammy he got overheated<br>
    And dropped dead of apoplexy: I felt better when he did!<br>
    For I'd got an awful singeing while I watched this mulga engine<br>
    Doing all that I've related ' through a cracked brick oven lid.
  </p>

  <p>"And when now I find men strangled, or I come across the mangled<br>
    Corpses of a crowd of people or depopulated towns,<br>
    Or even a blood-stained river, I can scarce repress a shiver,<br>
    For my nerves were much affected that day out on Boiling Downs.'
