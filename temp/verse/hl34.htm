<div class="verse">
  <p>
    He had offices in Sydney, not so many years ago,<br>
    And his shingle bore the legend `Peter Anderson and Co.',<br>
    But his real name was Careless, as the fellows understood -<br>
    And his relatives decided that he wasn't any good.<br>
    'Twas their gentle tongues that blasted any `character' he had -<br>
    He was fond of beer and leisure - and the Co. was just as bad.<br>
    It was limited in number to a unit, was the Co. -<br>
    'Twas a bosom chum of Peter and his Christian name was Joe.

    'Tis a class of men belonging to these soul-forsaken years:<br>
    Third-rate canvassers, collectors, journalists and auctioneers.<br>
    They are never very shabby, they are never very spruce -<br>
    Going cheerfully and carelessly and smoothly to the deuce.<br>
    Some are wanderers by profession, `turning up' and gone as soon,<br>
    Travelling second-class, or steerage (when it's cheap they go saloon);<br>
    Free from `ists' and `isms', troubled little by belief or doubt -<br>
    Lazy, purposeless, and useless - knocking round and hanging out.<br>
    They will take what they can get, and they will give what they can give,<br>
    God alone knows how they manage - God alone knows how they live!<br>
    They are nearly always hard-up, but are cheerful all the while -<br>
    Men whose energy and trousers wear out sooner than their smile!<br>
    They, no doubt, like us, are haunted by the boresome `if' or `might',<br>
    But their ghosts are ghosts of daylight - they are men who live at night!
  </p>

  <p>
    Peter met you with the comic smile of one who knows you well,<br>
    And is mighty glad to see you, and has got a joke to tell;<br>
    He could laugh when all was gloomy, he could grin when all was blue,<br>
    Sing a comic song and act it, and appreciate it, too.<br>
    Only cynical in cases where his own self was the jest,<br>
    And the humour of his good yarns made atonement for the rest.<br>
    Seldom serious - doing business just as 'twere a friendly game -<br>
    Cards or billiards - nothing graver. And the Co. was much the same.
  </p>

  <p>
    They tried everything and nothing 'twixt the shovel and the press,<br>
    And were more or less successful in their ventures - mostly less.<br>
    Once they ran a country paper till the plant was seized for debt,<br>
    And the local sinners chuckle over dingy copies yet.
  </p>

  <p>
    They'd been through it all and knew it in the land of Bills and Jims -<br>
    Using Peter's own expression, they had been in `various swims'.<br>
    Now and then they'd take an office, as they called it, - make a dash<br>
    Into business life as `agents' - something not requiring cash.<br>
    (You can always furnish cheaply, when your cash or credit fails,<br>
    With a packing-case, a hammer, and a pound of two-inch nails -<br>
    And, maybe, a drop of varnish and sienna, too, for tints,<br>
    And a scrap or two of oilcloth, and a yard or two of chintz).<br>
    They would pull themselves together, pay a week's rent in advance,<br>
    But it never lasted longer than a month by any chance.
  </p>

  <p>
    The office was their haven, for they lived there when hard-up -<br>
    A `daily' for a table cloth - a jam tin for a cup;<br>
    And if the landlord's bailiff happened round in times like these<br>
    And seized the office-fittings - well, there wasn't much to seize -<br>
    They would leave him in possession. But at other times they shot<br>
    The moon, and took an office where the landlord knew them not.<br>
    And when morning brought the bailiff there'd be nothing to be seen<br>
    Save a piece of bevelled cedar where the tenant's plate had been;<br>
    There would be no sign of Peter - there would be no sign of Joe<br>
    Till another portal boasted `Peter Anderson and Co.'
  </p>

  <p>
    And when times were locomotive, billiard-rooms and private bars -<br>
    Spicy parties at the cafe - long cab-drives beneath the stars;<br>
    Private picnics down the Harbour - shady campings-out, you know -<br>
    No one would have dreamed 'twas Peter -<br>
    no one would have thought 'twas Joe!<br>
    Free-and-easies in their `diggings', when the funds began to fail,<br>
    Bosom chums, cigars, tobacco, and a case of English ale -<br>
    Gloriously drunk and happy, till they heard the roosters crow -<br>
    And the landlady and neighbours made complaints about the Co.<br>
    But that life! it might be likened to a reckless drinking-song,<br>
    For it can't go on for ever, and it never lasted long.
  </p>

  <p>*****</p>

  <p>
    Debt-collecting ruined Peter - people talked him round too oft,<br>
    For his heart was soft as butter (and the Co.'s was just as soft);<br>
    He would cheer the haggard missus, and he'd tell her not to fret,<br>
    And he'd ask the worried debtor round with him to have a wet;<br>
    He would ask him round the corner, and it seemed to him and her,<br>
    After each of Peter's visits, things were brighter than they were.<br>
    But, of course, it wasn't business - only Peter's careless way;<br>
    And perhaps it pays in heaven, but on earth it doesn't pay.<br>
    They got harder up than ever, and, to make it worse, the Co.<br>
    Went more often round the corner than was good for him to go.
  </p>

  <p>
    `I might live,' he said to
    Peter, `but I haven't got the nerve -<br>
    I am going, Peter, going - going, going - no reserve.<br>
    Eat and drink and love they tell us, for to-morrow we may die,<br>
    Buy experience - and we bought it - we're experienced, you and I.'<br>
    Then, with a weary movement of his hand across his brow:<br>
    `The death of such philosophy's the death I'm dying now.<br>
    Pull yourself together, Peter; 'tis the dying wish of Joe<br>
    That the business world shall honour Peter Anderson and Co.
  </p>

  <p>
    `When you feel your life is
    sinking in a dull and useless course,<br>
    And begin to find in drinking keener pleasure and remorse -<br>
    When you feel the love of leisure on your careless heart take holt,<br>
    Break away from friends and pleasure, though it give your heart a jolt.<br>
    Shun the poison breath of cities - billiard-rooms and private bars,<br>
    Go where you can breathe God's air and see the grandeur of the stars!<br>
    Find again and follow up the old ambitions that you had -<br>
    See if you can raise a drink, old man, I'm feelin' mighty bad -<br>
    Hot and sweetened, nip o' butter - squeeze o' lemon, Pete,' he sighed.<br>
    And, while Peter went to fetch it, Joseph went to sleep - and died<br>
    With a smile - anticipation, maybe, of the peace to come,<br>
    Or a joke to try on Peter - or, perhaps, it was the rum.
  </p>

  <p>*****</p>

  <p>
    Peter staggered, gripped the
    table, swerved as some old drunkard swerves -<br>
    At a gulp he drank the toddy, just to brace his shattered nerves.<br>
    It was awful, if you like. But then he hadn't time to think -<br>
    All is nothing! Nothing matters! Fill your glasses - dead man's drink.
  </p>

  <p>*****</p>

  <p>
    Yet, to show his heart was not of human decency bereft,<br>
    Peter paid the undertaker. He got drunk on what was left;<br>
    Then he shed some tears, half-maudlin, on the grave where lay the Co.,<br>
    And he drifted to a township where the city failures go.<br>
    Where, though haunted by the man he was, the wreck he yet might be,<br>
    Or the man he might have been, or by each spectre of the three,<br>
    And the dying words of Joseph, ringing through his own despair,<br>
    Peter `pulled himself together' and he started business there.
  </p>

  <p>
    But his life was very lonely, and his heart was very sad,<br>
    And no help to reformation was the company he had -<br>
    Men who might have been, who had been, but who were not in the swim -<br>
    'Twas a town of wrecks and failures - they appreciated him.<br>
    They would ask him who the Co. was - that queer company he kept -<br>
    And he'd always answer vaguely - he would say his partner slept;<br>
    That he had a `sleeping partner' - jesting while his spirit broke -<br>
    And they grinned above their glasses, for they took it as a joke.<br>
    He would shout while he had money, he would joke while he had breath -<br>
    No one seemed to care or notice how he drank himself to death;<br>
    Till at last there came a morning when his smile was seen no more -<br>
    He was gone from out the office, and his shingle from the door,<br>
    And a boundary-rider jogging out across the neighb'ring run<br>
    Was attracted by a something that was blazing in the sun;<br>
    And he found that it was Peter, lying peacefully at rest,<br>
    With a bottle close beside him and the shingle on his breast.<br>
    Well, they analysed the liquor, and it would appear that he<br>
    Qualified his drink with something good for setting spirits free.<br>
    Though 'twas plainly self-destruction - `'twas his own affair,' they said;<br>
    And the jury viewed him sadly, and they found - that he was dead.
