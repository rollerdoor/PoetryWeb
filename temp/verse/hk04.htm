<div class="verse">
  <p>
    From Andalusian gardens<br>
    I bring the rose and rue,<br>
    And leaves of subtle odour,<br>
    To weave a gift for you.<br>
    You'll know the reason wherefore<br>
    The sad is with the sweet;<br>
    My flowers may lie, as I would,<br>
    A carpet for your feet!
  </p>

  <p>
    The heart — the heart is constant;<br>
    It holds its secret, Dear!<br>
    But often in the night time<br>
    I keep awake for fear.<br>
    I have no hope to whisper,<br>
    I have no prayer to send,<br>
    God save you from such passion!<br>
    God help you from such end!
  </p>

  <p>
    You first, you last, you false love!<br>
    In dreams your lips I kiss,<br>
    And thus I greet your Shadow,<br>
    "Take this, and this, and this!"<br>
    When dews are on the casement,<br>
    And winds are in the pine,<br>
    I have you close beside me —<br>
    In sleep your mouth is mine.
  </p>

  <p>
    I never see you elsewhere;<br>
    You never think of me;<br>
    But fired with fever for you<br>
    Content I am to be.<br>
    You will not turn, my Darling,<br>
    Nor answer when I call;<br>
    But yours are soul and body<br>
    And love of mine and all!
  </p>

  <p>
    You splendid Spaniard! Listen —<br>
    My passion leaps to flame<br>
    For neck and cheek and dimple,<br>
    And cunning shades of shame!<br>
    I tell you, I would gladly<br>
    Give Hell myself to keep,<br>
    To cling to, half a moment,<br>
    The lips I taste in sleep.
  </p>
