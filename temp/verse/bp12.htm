    Halt! Who goes there? The sentry's call<br>
    Rose on the midnight air<br>
    Above the noises of the camp,<br>
    The roll of wheels, the horses' tramp.<br>
    The challenge echoed over all<br>
    Halt! Who goes there?
  </p>

  <p>
    A quaint old figure clothed in white,<br>
    He bore a staff of pine,<br>
    An ivy-wreath was on his head.<br>
    `Advance, oh friend,' the sentry said,<br>
    Advance, for this is Christmas night,<br>
    And give the countersign.'
  </p>

  <p>
    `No sign nor countersign have I,<br>
    Through many lands I roam<br>
    The whole world over far and wide,<br>
    To exiles all at Christmastide,<br>
    From those who love them tenderly<br>
    I bring a thought of home.
  </p>

  <p>
    `From English brook and Scottish burn,<br>
    From cold Canadian snows,<br>
    From those far lands ye hold most dear<br>
    I bring you all a greeting here,<br>
    A frond of a New Zealand fern,<br>
    A bloom of English rose.
  </p>

  <p>
    `From faithful wife and loving lass<br>
    I bring a wish divine,<br>
    For Christmas blessings on your head.'<br>
    `I wish you well,' the sentry said,<br>
    But here, alas! you may not pass<br>
    Without the countersign.'
  </p>

  <p>
    He vanished and the sentry's tramp<br>
    Re-echoed down the line.<br>
    It was not till the morning light<br>
    The soldiers knew that in the night<br>
    Old Santa Claus had come to camp<br>
    Without the countersign.
