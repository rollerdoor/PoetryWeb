    'Are you the Cove?' he spoke the words<br>
    As swagmen only can;<br>
    The Squatter freezingly inquired,<br>
    'What do you mean, my man?'
  </p>

  <p>
    'Are you the Cove?' his voice was stern,<br>
    His look was firm and keen;<br>
    Again the Squatter made reply,<br>
    "I don't know what you mean."
  </p>

  <p>
    '0! dash my rags! let's have some sense '<br>
    You ain't a fool, by Jove,<br>
    Gammon you dunno what I mean;<br>
    I mean 'are you the Cove?'
  </p>

  <p>
    'Yes, I'm the Cove,' the Squatter said;<br>
    The Swagman answered, "Right,<br>
    I thought as much: show me some place<br>
    Where I can doss tonight."
