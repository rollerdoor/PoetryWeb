    May I Hear the Kookaburras Once Again

  <p>
    May a fading fancy hover round a gladness that is over?<br>
    May a dreamer in the silence rake the ashes of the past?<br>
    So a spirit might awaken in the best the years have taken,<br>
    And the Jove that left him lonely might be with him at the last.<br>
    While he searches in the by-ways, shall his heart forget the highways<br>
    Where the sunburnt arms are toiling in the sun-shine and the rain,<br>
    Where the simple things and lowly make their lives sublime and holy,<br>
    And the kookaburras chorus once again?
  </p>

  <p>
    There's a little house a-peeping o'er the swaying and the sweeping<br>
    Of the wheat that nods and ripples as the breezes skim its top;<br>
    And the days of pioneering in the ringing and the clearing<br>
    See the first-born of their labours in the house behind the crop.<br>
    There the fallow land is showing where the box and pine were growing,<br>
    And a sweet hope gilds the future with the colour of the grain;<br>
    Gentle visions softly tripping in the ploughing and the stripping,<br>
    While the kookaburras chorus once again.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let a, dying fancy hover round the glories that are over;<br>
    Lift a song to sing the present — to the hopeless hope impart —<br>
    For above the past's bewailing, golden-writ but unavailing,<br>
    Is the simple little ditty that can cheer a drooping heart.<br>
    Lift it high for all to hear it. In the Helper's love endear it,<br>
    And my ageing heart shall hasten to applaud the sweet refrain;<br>
    Yes, I'd feel the pulses stirring to the splendid truth recurring,<br>
    Could I hear the kookaburras once again.
  </p>

  <p>
    Could I hear them as I heard them when the joy of living spurred them,<br>
    When the world was clean and wholesome and they laughed the gloom away,<br>
    All the fatal fiction scorning that the canvas of the morning<br>
    Is but splashed with faded colours from the brush of yesterday.<br>
    Oh, I'd bless them and I'd cheer them, could I wander off and hear them<br>
    Boom the head-lights of the coming day that sweep the hills amain,<br>
    For I'd know the tocsin sounding of a fuller hope abounding,<br>
    Could I hear them hail the dawning once again.
  </p>

  <p>
    To no age in all the story of the bearded years and hoary<br>
    Would I yield the future's promise in the mould of progress cast;<br>
    Still, a fading fancy lingers, while the touch of gentle angers<br>
    Moves aside the sombre curtain that was drawn across the past.<br>
    Come the fairy visions winging, come the laughter and the singing,<br>
    But the shadows fall around me and the echo dies in pain;<br>
    Yet I'd feel the wings that bore me when the world was all before me,<br>
    Could I hear the kookaburras once again.
