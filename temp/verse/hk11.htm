<div class="verse">
  <p>
    While the morning light beams on the fern-matted streams,<br>
    And the water-pools flash in its glow,<br>
    Down the ridges we fly, with a loud ringing cry —<br>
    Down the ridges and gullies we go!<br>
    And the cattle we hunt — they are racing in front,<br>
    With a roar like the thunder of waves,<br>
    As the beat and the beat of our swift horses' feet<br>
    Start the echoes away from their caves!<br>
    As the beat and the beat<br>
    Of our swift horses' feet<br>
    Start the echoes away from their caves!
  </p>

  <p>
    Like a wintry shore that the waters ride o'er,<br>
    All the lowlands are filling with sound;<br>
    For swiftly we gain where the herds on the plain,<br>
    Like a tempest, are tearing the ground!<br>
    And we'll follow them hard to the rails of the yard,<br>
    O'er the gulches and mountain-tops grey,<br>
    Where the beat and the beat of our swift horses' feet<br>
    Will die with the echoes away!<br>
    Where the beat and the beat<br>
    Of our swift horses' feet<br>
    Will die with the echoes away!
