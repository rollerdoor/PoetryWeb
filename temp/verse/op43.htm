  <p>
    Thief of the moon, thou robber of old delight,<br>
    Thy charms have stolen the star-gold, quenched the moon-<br>
    Cold, cold are the birds that, bubbling out of night,<br>
    Cried once to my ears their unremembered tune-<br>
    Dark are those orchards, their leaves no longer shine,<br>
    No orange's gold is globed like moonrise there-<br>
    O thief of the earth's old loveliness, once mine,<br>
    Why dost thou waste all beauty to make thee fair?
  </p>

  <p>
    Break, break thy strings, thou lutanists of earth,<br>
    Thy musics touch me not-let midnight cover<br>
    With pitchy seas those leaves of orange and lime,<br>
    I'll not repent. The world's no longer worth<br>
    One smile from thee, dear pirate of place and time,<br>
    Thief of old loves that haunted once thy lover!
