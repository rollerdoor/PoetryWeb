  <p>
    Lofty Lane was a squadron scout,<br>
    Supple and long and loose of limb;<br>
    All spare happiness round about <br>
    Shone in the laughing eyes of him:<br>
    Never a man in his troop could show<br>
    Lane in the saddle the way to go.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lane was a man who played with chance, <br>
    Times whenever the work came fast;<br>
    First man out in the swift advance,<br>
    Last man in when the day was past.<br>
    Many a clip of Turkish lead<br>
    Was aimed at Lane's gay heart and head.
  </p>

  <p>
    Brazen summer began to brood, <br>
    Shrouding the hills with sombre haze; <br>
    Acres of uncut wheat that stood, <br>
    Shuddered and smoked and leapt ablaze.<br>
    Nature hardened its heart like stone,<br>
    When Lane rode into the hills alone.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lane rode off from his squadron mate, <br>
    Over the fretting skyline's rim;<br>
    Laden with harm and black with hate, <br>
    Gully and hill in smoke grew dim.<br>
    Shots rang out in the hills that day,<br>
    And Lane was never so long away;
  </p>

  <p>
    Never so long, that grave alarm<br>
    Before had murmured, "Lofty's dead." <br>
    Rumour announced: "The hand of harm <br>
    Let loose an ounce of well-aimed lead<br>
    And jolted the life-light from the face<br>
    That ever was welcome round the place."
  </p>

  <p>
    Never had action waned his pluck, <br>
    Quelled or slackened his pleasing power, <br>
    And many assert that rotten luck <br>
    Hemmed him around in an evil hour;<br>
    And some men vow that Lofty Lane<br>
    Will live to greet all hands again.
  </p>

  <p>
    Doubt hangs over the horselines still,<br>
    Yet we have searched and searched, in vain, <br>
    North and east of the furthest hill<br>
    That ever was crossed by Lofty Lane;<br>
    And there are many who gravely say<br>
    That Lane's alive in the east today.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gaps are many at times, alas;<br>
    War is heavy on life and limb,<br>
    And many a weary day will pass <br>
    Before a man replaces him,<br>
    A man with a smile upon his face<br>
    That ever is welcome round the place.
