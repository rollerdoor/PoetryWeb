  <p>
    The world is narrow and ways are short, and our lives are dull and slow,<br>
    For little is new where the crowds resort, and less where the wanderers go;<br>
    Greater, or smaller, the same old things we see by the dull road-side —<br>
    And tired of all is the spirit that sings of the days when the world was wide.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the North was hale in the march of Time, and the South and the West were new,<br>
    And the gorgeous East was a pantomime, as it seemed in our boyhood's view;<br>
    When Spain was first on the waves of change, and proud in the ranks of pride,<br>
    And all was wonderful, new and strange in the days when the world was wide.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then a man could fight if his heart were bold, and win if his faith were true —<br>
    Were it love, or honour, or power, or gold, or all that our hearts pursue;<br>
    Could live to the world for the family name, or die for the family pride,<br>
    Could fly from sorrow, and wrong, and shame in the days when the world was wide.
  </p>

  <p>
    They sailed away in the ships that sailed ere science controlled the main,<br>
    When the strong, brave heart of a man prevailed as 'twill never prevail again;<br>
    They knew not whither, nor much they cared —< let
      Fate
      or
      the
      winds
      decide
      —<br>
      The worst of the Great Unknown they dared in the days when the world was wide.
  </p>

  <p>
    They raised new stars on the silent sea that filled their hearts with awe;<br>
    They came to many a strange countree and marvellous sights they saw.<br>
    The villagers gaped at the tales they told, and old eyes glistened with pride —<br>
    When barbarous cities were paved with gold in the days when the world was wide.
  </p>

  <p>
    'Twas honest metal and honest wood, in the days of the Outward Bound,<br>
    When men were gallant and ships were good — roaming the wide world round.<br>
    The gods could envy a leader then when `Follow me, lads!' he cried —<br>
    They faced each other and fought like men in the days when the world was wide.
  </p>

  <p>
    They tried to live as a freeman should — they were happier men than we,<br>
    In the glorious days of wine and blood, when Liberty crossed the sea;<br>
    'Twas a comrade true or a foeman then, and a trusty sword well tried —<br>
    They faced each other and fought like men in the days when the world was wide.
  </p>

  <p>
    The good ship bound for the Southern seas when the beacon was Ballarat,<br>
    With a `Ship ahoy!' on the freshening breeze, `Where bound?' and `What ship's that?' —<br>
    The emigrant train to New Mexico — the rush to the Lachlan Side —<br>
    Ah! faint is the echo of Westward Ho! from the days when the world was wide.
  </p>

  <p>
    South, East, and West in advance of Time — and, ay! in advance of Thought<br>
    Those brave men rose to a height sublime — and is it for this they fought?<br>
    And is it for this damned life we praise the god-like spirit that died<br>
    At Eureka Stockade in the Roaring Days with the days when the world was wide?
  </p>

  <p>
    We fight like women, and feel as much; the thoughts of our hearts we guard;<br>
    Where scarcely the scorn of a god could touch, the sneer of a sneak hits hard;<br>
    The treacherous tongue and cowardly pen, the weapons of curs, decide —<br>
    They faced each other and fought like men in the days when the world was wide.
  </p>

  <p>
    Think of it all — of the life that is! Study your friends and foes!<br>
    Study the past! And answer this: `Are these times better than those?'<br>
    The life-long quarrel, the paltry spite, the sting of your poisoned pride!<br>
    No matter who fell it were better to fight as they did when the world was wide.
  </p>

  <p>
    Boast as you will of your mateship now — crippled and mean and sly —<br>
    The lines of suspicion on friendship's brow were traced since the days gone by.<br>
    There was room in the long, free lines of the van to fight for it side by side —<br>
    There was beating-room for the heart of a man in the days when the world was wide.
  </p>

  <p>*****</p>

  <p>
    With its dull, brown days of a-shilling-an-hour the dreary year drags round:<br>
    Is this the result of Old England's power? — the bourne of the Outward Bound?<br>
    Is this the sequel of Westward Ho! — of the days of Whate'er Betide?<br>
    The heart of the rebel makes answer `No! We'll fight till the world grows wide!'
  </p>

  <p>
    The world shall yet be a wider world — for the tokens are manifest;<br>
    East and North shall the wrongs be hurled that followed us South and West.<br>
    The march of Freedom is North by the Dawn! Follow, whate'er betide!<br>
    Sons of the Exiles, march! March on! March till the world grows wide!.
