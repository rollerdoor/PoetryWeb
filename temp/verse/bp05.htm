  <p>
    It was the man from Ironbark who struck the Sydney town,<br>
    He wandered over street and park, he wandered up and down.<br>
    He loitered here he loitered there, till he was like to drop,<br>
    Until at last in sheer despair he sought a barber's shop.<br>
    "Ere! shave my beard and whiskers off, I'll be a man of mark,<br>
    I'll go and do the Sydney toff up home in Ironbark."
  </p>

  <p>
    The barber man was small and flash, as barbers mostly are,<br>
    He wore a strike-your-fancy sash he smoked a huge cigar;<br>
    He was a humorist of note and keen at repartee,<br>
    He laid the odds and kept a "tote", whatever that may be,<br>
    And when he saw our friend arrive, he whispered, "Here's a lark!<br>
    Just watch me catch him all alive, this man from Ironbark."
  </p>

  <p>
    There were some gilded youths that sat along the barber's wall.<br>
    Their eyes were dull, their heads were flat, they had no brains at all;<br>
    To them the barber passed the wink his dexter eyelid shut,<br>
    "I'll make this bloomin' yokel think his bloomin' throat is cut."<br>
    And as he soaped and rubbed it in he made a rude remark:<br>
    "I s'pose the flats is pretty green up there in Ironbark."
  </p>

  <p>
    A grunt was all reply he got; he shaved the bushman's chin,<br>
    Then made the water boiling hot and dipped the razor in.<br>
    He raised his hand, his brow grew black, he paused awhile to gloat,<br>
    Then slashed the red-hot razor-back across his victim's throat;<br>
    Upon the newly-shaven skin it made a livid mark -<br>
    No doubt it fairly took him in - the man from Ironbark.
  </p>

  <p>
    He fetched a wild up-country yell might wake the dead to hear,<br>
    And though his throat, he knew full well, was cut from ear to ear,<br>
    He struggled gamely to his feet, and faced the murd'rous foe:<br>
    "You've done for me! you dog, I'm beat! one hit before I go!<br>
    I only wish I had a knife, you blessed murdering shark!<br>
    But you'll remember all your life the man from Ironbark."
  </p>

  <p>
    He lifted up his hairy paw, with one tremendous clout<br>
    He landed on the barber's jaw, and knocked the barber out.<br>
    He set to work with nail and tooth, he made the place a wreck;<br>
    He grabbed the nearest gilded youth, and tried to break his neck.<br>
    And all the while his throat he held to save his vital spark,<br>
    And "Murder! Bloody murder!" yelled the man from Ironbark.
  </p>

  <p>
    A peeler man who heard the din came in to see the show;<br>
    He tried to run the bushman in, but he refused to go.<br>
    And when at last the barber spoke, and said "'Twas all in fun'<br>
    Twas just a little harmless joke, a trifle overdone."<br>
    "A joke!" he cried, "By George, that's fine; a lively sort of lark;<br>
    I'd like to catch that murdering swine some night in Ironbark."
  </p>

  <p>
    And now while round the shearing floor the list'ning shearers gape,<br>
    He tells the story o'er and o'er, and brags of his escape.<br>
    "Them barber chaps what keeps a tote, By George, I've had enough,<br>
    One tried to cut my bloomin' throat, but thank the Lord it's tough."<br>
    And whether he's believed or no, there's one thing to remark,<br>
    That flowing beards are all the go way up in Ironbark.
