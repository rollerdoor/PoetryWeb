    There's a road outback that becomes a track<br>
    Where the hills dip down to the plain;<br>
    And on misty moonlit nights up there<br>
    The old inhabitants all declare<br>
    On his big black stallion (or was it a mare?)<br>
    Raferty rides again.
  </p>

  <p>
    A bushranger bold in the days of old,<br>
    T-was an evil name that he bore,<br>
    Till they shot him down from behind a tree â€”<br>
    At least that's the yarn they told to me<br>
    When I asked who this Rafferty bloke might be,<br>
    And what he was riding for.
  </p>

  <p>
    And now it appears, after all the years<br>
    That low in his grave he has lain,<br>
    That o'er the hills, in the same old way,<br>
    Dashing and debonair, reckless, gay,<br>
    On his chestnut charger (or was it a bay))<br>
    Raferty rides again.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have waited long the old hills among,<br>
    But my vigils have been in vain;<br>
    I've perched all night in a towering tree,<br>
    But devil a ride he'd pick for me,<br>
    Though I would have given the world to see<br>
    Rafferty ride again.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the tale is true that I'm telling you,<br>
    Though it's ages since he was slain;<br>
    To all the folk in the hills 'tis known<br>
    That, awesome and spectral, and all alone,<br>
    On his snow-white courser (or was it a roan)<br>
    Rafferty rides again.
