<div class="verse">
  <p>
    With speechless lips and solemn tread<br>
    They brought the Lawyer-Statesman home:<br>
    They laid him with the gather'd dead,<br>
    Where rich and poor like brothers come.
  </p>

  <p>
    How bravely did the stripling climb,<br>
    From step to step the rugged hill:<br>
    His gaze thro' that benighted time<br>
    Fix'd on the far-off beacon still.
  </p>

  <p>
    He faced the storm that o'er him burst,<br>
    With pride to match the proudest born:<br>
    He bore unblench'd Detraction's worst, --<br>
    Paid blow for blow, and scorn for scorn.
  </p>

  <p>
    He scaled the summit while the sun<br>
    Yet shone upon his conquer'd track:<br>
    Nor falter'd till the goal was won,<br>
    Nor struggling upward, once look'd back.
  </p>

  <p>
    But what avails the "pride of place",<br>
    Or winged chariot rolling past?<br>
    He heeds not now who wins the race,<br>
    Alike to him the first or last.
