  <p>
    From the runs of the Narran, wide-dotted with sheep,<br>
    And loud with the lowing of cattle,<br>
    We speed for a land where the strange forests sleep<br>
    And the hidden creeks bubble and brattle!<br>
    Now call on the horses, and leave the blind courses<br>
    And sources of rivers that all of us know;<br>
    For, crossing the ridges, and passing the ledges,<br>
    And running up gorges, we'll come to the verges<br>
    Of gullies where waters eternally flow.<br>
    Oh! the herds they will rush down the spurs of the hill<br>
    To feed on the grasses so cool and so sweet;<br>
    And I think that my life with delight will stand still<br>
    When we halt with the pleasant Barcoo at our feet.

  <p>
    Good-bye to the Barwon, and brigalow scrubs,<br>
    Adieu to the Culgoa ranges,<br>
    But look for the mulga and salt-bitten shrubs,<br>
    Though the face of the forest-land changes.<br>
    The leagues we may travel down beds of hot gravel,<br>
    And clay-crusted reaches where moisture hath been,<br>
    While searching for waters, may vex us and thwart us,<br>
    Yet who would be quailing, or fainting, or failing?<br>
    Not you, who are men of the Narran, I ween!<br>
    When we leave the dry channels away to the south,<br>
    And reach the far plains we are journeying to,<br>
    We will cry, though our lips may be glued with the drouth,<br>
    Hip, hip, and hurrah for the pleasant Barcoo!
