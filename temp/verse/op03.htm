  <p>
    In the far-off town of 'Somewhere' where the drifters come and go.<br>
    There's half a town of locals, and the half that no-one knows.
  </p>

  <p>
    There's characters that are of note, and there's leaders in the town,<br>
    Druggos, drunks and lay-abouts, and bludgers hanging 'round.
  </p>

  <p>
    This makes up all the populace and be that as it may,<br>
    There's always something going on every single day.
  </p>

  <p>
    One character well known to all 's been there since time began,<br>
    He's known by all the citizens as 'that dirty man', old Dan.
  </p>

  <p>
    He's never been known to take a bath, or even wash his hands,<br>
    The smell of him is always more than any one can stand.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now Jimmy Mack the fencer, had a heeler that was bad<br>
    With a double dose of rabies who was always going mad.
  </p>

  <p>
    When Dan walked by one evening Jimmy's dog broke from it's chain,<br>
    And bolted head-long after Dan who was traipsing down the lane.
  </p>

  <p>
    He savaged Dan around the legs and bit him on the hand<br>
    Till Jimmy fetched him home again in time to save old Dan.
  </p>

  <p>
    The St. Johns bloke attended Dan, the stench near made him cry,<br>
    Odds were laid at the Royal Hotel on the time that Dan would die.
  </p>

  <p>The town was in a frenzy, but when morning brought another day,<br>
    All were surprised to find the dog, not Dan, had passed away
  </p>
