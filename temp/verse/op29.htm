    This talk of wild bulls of the Dawson scrubs, says old Joe, leaves me cold.<br>
    But I tells you bulls were dinkum cows in them Speewah days of old,<br>
    More fiercer than the fiercest cat â€” more cunning than the blacks,<br>
    You'd see 'em drag branches on their tails to cover up their tracks.
  </p>

  <p>
    You must put right out on leaving camp the fire you've had at night,<br>
    For them bulls would carry firesticks in their teeth and set your yards alight,<br>
    To bellow they had the bower-birds squared to coax you off your course, <br>
    Why they even had the dingoes trained to heel your blanky horse.
  </p>

  <p>
    I mind one day there's six of us to muster back to Jackass yard,<br>
    There was never better ringers in the land, used we was to riding fast and hard; <br>
    The boss was there on a raking bay, his pet camp-horse, Swift Desire, <br>
    While I kids meself I looks a treat on my black mare, Opal Fire.
  </p>

  <p>
    Soon we sights a score or so of bulls, they're as contented as you please, <br>
    Some is sharpening horns on sandstone rocks while some is skewering trees;<br>
    Well, we makes them blooming cattle go as hard as they can lick,<br>
    Though every time I looks behind seems to me they're gaining quick.
  </p>

  <p>
    There's a big roan bloke about a yard behind when down comes me mare and me,<br>
    So just to see the other blokes is right I starts up the nearest tree;<br>
    That old bull ain't a bloomin' snob, he helps me with a whack,<br>
    Perhaps I goes up a little fast, I grabs a good limb coming back.
  </p>

  <p>
    Well, I'm up here and he's down there, seems as if he'd like to stay, <br>
    Then as I have no use for him I lets him mooch away,<br>
    Down I comes and grabs me mare (her foot's caught in the rein), <br>
    And I'm as keen as mustard now to help me mates again.
  </p>

  <p>
    I circles round and cuts their tracks but stares hard at the trail,<br>
    All them blokes has still been in the lead, there's been none on wing and tail;<br>
    They're heading straight for Jackass yard, it's plain the way they went <br>
    They've torn two-foot trees out by the roots, even the hills seem bent.
  </p>

  <p>
    But when I gets in sight of that there yard I just stops goggle-eyed,<br>
    For them blarmed bulls is camping by the gate, it's the ringers wot's inside. <br>
    So now when I hears them talk of Dawson days my thoughts fly back to when <br>
    The wild bulls of the Speewah scrubs would muster up the men.
