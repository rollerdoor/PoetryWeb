    "We'll all be rooned," said Hanrahan<br>
    In accents most forlorn<br>
    Outside the church ere Mass began<br>
    One frosty Sunday morn.
  </p>

  <p>
    The congregation stood about,<br>
    Coat-collars to the ears,<br>
    And talked of stock and crops and drought <br>
    As it had done for years.
  </p>

  <p>
    "It's lookin' crook," said Daniel Croke;<br>
    "Bedad, it's cruke, me lad<br>
    For never since the banks went broke <br>
    Has seasons been so bad."
  </p>

  <p>
    "It's dry, all right," said young O'Neil,<br>
    With which astute remark<br>
    He squatted down upon his heel<br>
    And chewed a piece of bark.
  </p>

  <p>
    And so around the chorus ran<br>
    "It's keepin' dry, no doubt."<br>
    "We'll all be rooned," said Hanrahan,<br>
    "Before the year is out.
  </p>

  <p>
    "The crops are done; ye'll have your work <br>
    To save one bag of grain;<br>
    From here way out to Back-O'-Bourke <br>
    They're singin' out for rain.
  </p>

  <p>
    "They're singin' out for rain," he said, <br>
    "And all the tanks are dry."<br>
    The congregation scratched its head, <br>
    And gazed around the sky.
  </p>

  <p>
    "There won't be grass, in any case,<br>
    Enough to feed an ass;<br>
    There's not a blade on Casey's place<br>
    As I came down to Mass."
  </p>

  <p>
    "If rain don't come this month," said Dan, <br>
    And cleared his throat to speak â€” <br>
    "We'll all be rooned," said Hanrahan, "<br>
    If rain don't come this week."
  </p>

  <p>
    A heavy silence seemed to steal<br>
    On all at this remark;<br>
    And each man squatted on his heel,<br>
    And chewed a piece of bark.
  </p>

  <p>
    "We want an inch of rain, we do,"<br>
    O'Neil observed at last;<br>
    But Croke "maintained" we wanted two<br>
    To put the danger past.
  </p>

  <p>
    "If we don't get three inches, man,<br>
    Or four to break this drought,<br>
    We'll all be rooned," said Hanrahan,<br>
    "Before the year is out."
  </p>

  <p>
    In God's good time
    down came the rain;<br>
    And all the afternoon<br>
    On iron roof and window-pane<br>
    It drummed a homely tune.
  </p>

  <p>
    And through the night it pattered still,<br>
    And lightsome, gladsome elves<br>
    On dripping spout and window-sill<br>
    Kept talking to themselves.
  </p>

  <p>
    It pelted, pelted all day long,<br>
    A-singing at its work,<br>
    Till every heart took up the song<br>
    Way out to Back-O'-Bourke.
  </p>

  <p>
    And every creek a banker ran,<br>
    And dams filled overtop;<br>
    "We'll all be rooned," said Hanrahan,<br>
    "If this rain doesn't stop."
  </p>

  <p>
    And stop it did, in God's good time:<br>
    And spring came in to fold<br>
    A mantle o'er the hills sublime<br>
    Of green and pink and gold.
  </p>

  <p>
    And days went by on dancing feet,<br>
    With harvest-hopes immense,<br>
    And laughing eyes beheld the wheat<br>
    Nid-nodding o'er the fence.
  </p>

  <p>
    And, oh, the smiles on every face,<br>
    As happy lad and lass<br>
    Through grass knee-deep on Casey's place<br>
    Went riding down to Mass.
  </p>

  <p>
    While round the church in clothes genteel<br>
    Discoursed the men of mark,<br>
    And each man squatted on his heel,<br>
    And chewed his piece of bark.
  </p>

  <p>
    "There'll be bush-fires for sure, me man,<br>
    There will, without a doubt;<br>
    We'll all be rooned," said Hanrahan,<br>
    "Before the year is out."
