    "Look out on your left," said McKenzie, "the cattle are off like a streak! -<br>
    Rouse up the camp as you're passing" - his words seemed to end in a shriek.<br>
    And instantly into the saddle and out in the teeth of the rain,<br>
    We followed like fiends demented out o'er the soft Boree plain;<br>
    The splash of the hoofs through the gilgais and snapping of horns far in front<br>
    As the mad cattle raced helter-skelter, solely our guide in the hunt.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Hell take it, I'm down," said the darkie, "walla-walla make terrible hole."<br>
    But no time had I to stay nursing, or think of a body or soul,<br>
    But to get to the head ere they scattered out through the scrubs on the right.<br>
    So on with the clogs racing after, we rode through the depths of the night<br>
    Till, presently, down went my charger, hard o'er a log in the mud -<br>
    And when I arose shortly after, all shaken and dripping with blood,<br>
    And my brave stockhorse "Taffy" bespattered, I knew as I mounted again<br>
    There's many a game more alluring than a break on the Billabong plain.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the maddest of breaks has an ending - and after a twenty-mile run,<br>
    We headed the badly-blown leaders, and with the first tint of the sun<br>
    While the mists of the night were departing we leisurely counted the cost:<br>
    The black had a leg badly broken, our young British drover was "lost",
  </p>

  <p>
    McKenzie was battered all over, and Nicholls as sore as myself,<br>
    And if hospitals there were availing we'd all have been laid on the shelf;<br>
    But only six pikers were missing, and scarcely a dozen were maimed -<br>
    Some minus eyes, others horns, and others a little lamed -<br>
    So we reckoned we'd call ourselves lucky, and on through the rest of the bush,<br>
    It was plain that the cattle conceded we had beaten them bad in the rush.
