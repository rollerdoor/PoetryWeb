<div class="verse">
  <p>
    The gums in the gully stand gloomy and stark,<br>
    A torrent beneath them is leaping,<br>
    And the wind goes about like a ghost in the dark<br>
    Where a chief of Wahibbi lies sleeping!<br>
    He dreams of a battle — of foes of the past,<br>
    But he hears not the whooping abroad on the blast,<br>
    Nor the fall of the feet that are travelling fast.<br>
    Oh, why dost thou slumber, Kooroora?
  </p>

  <p>
    They come o'er the hills in their terrible ire,<br>
    And speed by the woodlands and water;<br>
    They look down the hills at the flickering fire,<br>
    All eager and thirsty for slaughter.<br>
    Lo! the stormy moon glares like a torch from the vale,<br>
    And a voice in the belah grows wild in its wail,<br>
    As the cries of the Wanneroos swell with the gale —<br>
    Oh! rouse thee and meet them, Kooroora!
  </p>

  <p>
    He starts from his sleep and he clutches his spear,<br>
    And the echoes roll backward in wonder,<br>
    For a shouting strikes into the hollow woods near,<br>
    Like the sound of a gathering thunder.<br>
    He clambers the ridge, with his face to the light,<br>
    The foes of Wahibbi come full in his sight —<br>
    The waters of Mooki will redden to-night.<br>
    Go! and glory awaits thee, Kooroora!
  </p>

  <p>
    Lo! yeelamans splinter and boomerangs clash,<br>
    And a spear through the darkness is driven —<br>
    It whizzes along like a wandering flash<br>
    From the heart of a hurricane riven.<br>
    They turn to the mountains, that gloomy-browed band;<br>
    The rain droppeth down with a moan to the land,<br>
    And the face of a chieftain lies buried in sand —<br>
    Oh, the light that was quenched with Kooroora!
  </p>

  <p>
    To-morrow the Wanneroo dogs will rejoice,<br>
    And feast in this desolate valley;<br>
    But where are his brothers — the friends of his choice,<br>
    And why art thou absent, Ewalli?<br>
    Now silence draws back to the forest again,<br>
    And the wind, like a wayfarer, sleeps on the plain,<br>
    But the cheeks of a warrior bleach in the rain.<br>
    Oh! where are thy mourners, Kooroora?
