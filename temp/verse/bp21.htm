    He came from `further out',<br>
    That land of heat and drought<br>
    And dust and gravel.<br>
    He got a touch of sun,<br>
    And rested at the run<br>
    Until his cure was done,<br>
    And he could travel.
  </p>

  <p>
    When spring had decked the plain,<br>
    He flitted off again<br>
    As flit the swallows.<br>
    And from that western land,<br>
    When many months were spanned,<br>
    A letter came to hand,<br>
    Which read as follows:
  </p>

  <p>
    `Dear sir, I take my pen<br>
    In hopes that all your men<br>
    And you are hearty.<br>
    You think that I've forgot<br>
    Your kindness, Mr. Scott,<br>
    Oh, no, dear sir, I'm not<br>
    That sort of party.
  </p>

  <p>
    `You sometimes bet, I know,<br>
    Well, now you'll have a show<br>
    The `books' to frighten.<br>
    Up here at Wingadee<br>
    Young Billy Fife and me<br>
    We're training Strife, and he<br>
    Is a all right 'un.
  </p>

  <p>
    `Just now we're running byes,<br>
    But, sir, first time he tries<br>
    I'll send you word of.<br>
    And running `on the crook'<br>
    Their measures we have took,<br>
    It is the deadest hook<br>
    You ever heard of.
  </p>

  <p>
    `So when we lets him go,<br>
    Why, then, I'll let you know,<br>
    And you can have a show<br>
    To put a mite on.<br>
    Now, sir, my leave I'll take,<br>
    Yours truly, William Blake.<br>
    P.S. -- Make no mistake,<br>
    HE'S A ALL RIGHT 'UN.'
  </p>

  <p>
    By next week's RIVERINE<br>
    I saw my friend had been<br>
    A bit too cunning.<br>
    I read: `The racehorse Strife<br>
    And jockey William Fife<br>
    Disqualified for life --<br>
    Suspicious running.'
  </p>

  <p>
    But though they spoilt his game,<br>
    I reckon all the same<br>
    I fairly ought to claim<br>
    My friend a white 'un.<br>
    For though he wasn't straight,<br>
    His deeds would indicate<br>
    His heart at any rate<br>
    Was `a all right 'un'.
