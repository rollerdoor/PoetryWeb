<div class="verse">
  <p>
    The men who camp with Danger<br>
    Are mostly quiet men:<br>
    And one may use a rifle,<br>
    And one may use a pen,<br>
    And one may strap a camera<br>
    In deserts to his bike;<br>
    But men who sleep with Danger<br>
    Are pretty much alike.
  </p>

  <p>
    To men in places pleasant<br>
    Or in the barren West<br>
    There's Danger ever present –<br>
    A half unheeded guest.<br>
    But , thoughtful for the stranger,<br>
    The timid or the weak –<br>
    The men who camp with Danger<br>
    Keep watch but do not speak.
  </p>

  <p>
    The men who go with Danger<br>
    Are mostly dreamy-eyed<br>
    Upon the swooping fo'c'sle.<br>
    Or by the camp-fire side,<br>
    And when they sit in darkness,<br>
    To show us where they are:<br>
    The glowing of a pipe-bowl<br>
    And often a cigar
  </p>

  <p>
    The men who camp with Danger<br>
    Have quiet humour too,<br>
    And songs that you've forgotten,<br>
    And real good yarns for you.<br>
    There's little you can tell them<br>
    Of yourself or your own<br>
    That men who've lived with Danger<br>
    Have never felt or known.
  </p>

  <p>
    The men who sleep with Danger<br>
    Sleep soundly while they may,<br>
    But always wake at midnight<br>
    Or just before the day.<br>
    A something in the darkness<br>
    That shudders at the dawn –<br>
    A side-mate softly wakened,<br>
    A rifle swiftly drawn.
  </p>

  <p>
    The men who sail with Danger<br>
    As actors are ideal:<br>
    They lightly laugh to fool you<br>
    When Danger's very real.<br>
    The men who sail with Danger<br>
    A wondrous insight have:<br>
    They know if you are timid,<br>
    They know if you are brave.
  </p>

  <p>
    The stewards set the tables<br>
    With careless, practised care,<br>
    And take accustomed comforts<br>
    To sea-sick cabins there.<br>
    They knock at doors of state-rooms<br>
    With broth and tea and toast,<br>
    While well they know, it's touch and go,<br>
    And death sits on the coast.
  </p>

  <p>
    The man who lives with Danger<br>
    Has knowledge all his own;<br>
    The instinct of a woman,<br>
    Of men who fight alone.<br>
    He learns from peace and comfort,<br>
    He learns from care and strife;<br>
    Unwittingly from all things<br>
    And from his native wife.
  </p>

  <p>
    The men who live with Danger<br>
    See sermons in a log;<br>
    They have the nerves of horses,<br>
    The instincts of a dog,<br>
    When illness comes to loved ones<br>
    They know where'er they roam –<br>
    Have you seen, without for reason,<br>
    A farther start for home?
  </p>

  <p>
    They know and feel our &quot;warnings&quot;<br>
    As only Gipsies do;<br>
    They know the Norse Vardoger –<br>
    They hear and see it, too.<br>
    They know when death has passed them,<br>
    And the death watch is at end.<br>
    <span class="ital">They know when he is coming –<br>
      The Unexpected Friend.</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    The men who live with Danger,<br>
    They take things as they go –<br>
    In seeming unpreparedness,<br>
    To those who do not know.<br>
    They sleep when they have toiled and laughed<br>
    And fought for someone's sake;<br>
    But Danger whispers in their ear,<br>
    And they are wide awake !
