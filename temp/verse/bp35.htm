    You see, the thing was this way - there was me,<br>
    That rode Panoppoly, the Splendor mare,<br>
    And Ikey Chambers on the Iron Dook,<br>
    And Smith, the half-caste rider, on Regret,<br>
    And that long bloke from Wagga - him what rode<br>
    Veronikew, the Snowy River horse.<br>
    Well, none of them had chances - not a chance<br>
    Among the lot, unless the rest fell dead<br>
    Or wasn't trying - for a blind man's dog<br>
    Could see Enchantress was a certain cop,<br>
    And all the books was layin' six to four.
  </p>

  <p>
    They brought her out to show our lot the road,<br>
    Or so they said; but, then, Gord's truth! you know,<br>
    You can't believe 'em, though they took an oath<br>
    On forty Bibles that they'd tell the truth.<br>
    But anyhow, an amateur was up<br>
    On this Enchantress, and so Ike and me,<br>
    We thought that we might frighten him a bit<br>
    By asking if he minded riding rough -<br>
    `Oh, not at all,' says he, `oh, not at all!<br>
    I learnt at Robbo Park, and if it comes<br>
    To bumping I'm your Moses! Strike me blue!'<br>
    Says he, `I'll bump you over either rail,<br>
    The inside rail or outside - which you choose<br>
    Is good enough for me' - which settled Ike;<br>
    For he was shaky since he near got killed<br>
    From being sent a buster on the rail,<br>
    When some chap bumped his horse and fetched him down<br>
    At Stony Bridge, so Ikey thought it best<br>
    To leave this bloke alone, and I agreed.
  </p>

  <p>
    So all the books was layin' six to four<br>
    Against the favourite, and the amateur<br>
    Was walking this Enchantress up and down,<br>
    And me and Smithy backed him; for we thought<br>
    We might as well get something for ourselves,<br>
    Because we knew our horses couldn't win.<br>
    But Ikey wouldn't back him for a bob;<br>
    Because he said he reckoned he was stiff,<br>
    And all the books was layin' six to four.
  </p>

  <p>
    Well, anyhow, before the start, the news<br>
    Got round that this here amateur was stiff,<br>
    And our good stuff was blued, and all the books<br>
    Was in it, and the prices lengthened out,<br>
    And every book was bustin' of his throat,<br>
    And layin' five to one the favourite.<br>
    So there was we that couldn't win ourselves,<br>
    And this here amateur that wouldn't try,<br>
    And all the books was layin' five to one.
  </p>

  <p>
    So Smithy says to me, `You take a hold<br>
    Of that there moke of yours, and round the turn<br>
    Come up behind Enchantress with the whip<br>
    And let her have it; that long bloke and me<br>
    Will wait ahead, and when she comes to us<br>
    We'll pass her on and belt her down the straight,<br>
    And Ikey'll flog her home, because his boss<br>
    Is judge and steward and the Lord knows what,<br>
    And so he won't be touched - and, as for us,<br>
    We'll swear we only hit her by mistake!'<br>
    And all the books was layin' five to one.
  </p>

  <p>
    Well, off we went, and comin' to the turn<br>
    I saw the amateur was holding back<br>
    And poking into every hole he could<br>
    To get her blocked, and so I pulled behind<br>
    And drew the whip and dropped it on the mare -<br>
    I let her have it twice, and then she shot<br>
    Ahead of me, and Smithy opened out<br>
    And let her up beside him on the rails,<br>
    And kept her there a-beltin' her like smoke<br>
    Until she struggled past him pullin' hard<br>
    And came to Ike; but Ikey drew his whip<br>
    And hit her on the nose and sent her back<br>
    And won the race himself - for, after all,<br>
    It seems he had a fiver on the Dook<br>
    And never told us - so our stuff was lost.<br>
    And then they had us up for ridin' foul,<br>
    And warned us off the tracks for twelve months each,<br>
    To get our livin' any way we could;<br>
    But Ikey wasn't touched, because his boss<br>
    Was judge and steward and the Lord knows what.
  </p>

  <p>
    But Mister - if you'll lend us half-a-crown,<br>
    I know three certain winners at the Park -<br>
    Three certain cops as no one knows but me;<br>
    And - thank you, Mister, come an' have a beer<br>
    (I always like a beer about this time) . . .<br>
    Well, so long, Mister, till we meet again.
  </p>
